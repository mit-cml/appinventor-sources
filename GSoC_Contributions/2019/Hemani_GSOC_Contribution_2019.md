# GSoC 19 Project: Implementing Trash Can Functionality for MIT App Inventor

## Project Overview

Implementing Trash Functionality acts a folder that displays list of projects which are marked deleted by the user. This feature will help users to keep the unwanted or future use projects in Trash rather than completely deleting it. Even if the user clicks Delete button accidently, there is no need to worry about the loss of projects as they get stored in the Trash. Further, Trash has more options either to restore back the projects or permanently delete it or simply keep in Trash.
