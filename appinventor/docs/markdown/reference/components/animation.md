## Ball  {#Ball}

A round 'sprite' that can be placed on a [`Canvas`](#Canvas), where it can react to touches and drags,
 interact with other sprites ([`ImageSprite`](#ImageSprite)s and other `Ball`s) and the edge of the
 `Canvas`, and move according to its property values.

 For example, to have a `Ball` move 4 pixels toward the top of a `Canvas` every 500 milliseconds
 (half second), you would set the [`Speed`](#Ball.Speed) property to 4 [pixels], the
 [`Interval`](#Ball.Interval) property to 500 [milliseconds], the [`Heading`](#Ball.Heading) property to
 90 [degrees], and the [`Enabled`](#Ball.Enabled) property to `true`{:.logic.block}. These and its
 other properties can be changed at any time.

 The difference between a `Ball` and an `ImageSprite` is that the latter can get its appearance
 from an image file, while a `Ball`'s appearance can only be changed by varying its
 [`PaintColor`](#Ball.PaintColor) and [`Radius`](#Ball.Radius) properties.



### Properties  {#Ball-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="Ball.Enabled" .boolean} *Enabled*
: Controls whether the `Ball` moves when its speed is non-zero.

{:id="Ball.Heading" .number} *Heading*
: The `Ball`'s heading in degrees above the positive x-axis. Zero degrees is toward the right
 of the screen; 90 degrees is toward the top of the screen.

{:id="Ball.Interval" .number} *Interval*
: The interval in milliseconds at which the `Ball`'s position is updated. For example, if the
 `Interval` is 50 and the [`Speed`](#Ball.Speed) is 10, then the `Ball` will move 10 pixels
 every 50 milliseconds.

{:id="Ball.OriginAtCenter" .boolean .wo .do} *OriginAtCenter*
: Whether the x- and y-coordinates should represent the center of the `Ball`
 (`true`{:.logic.block}) or its left and top edges (`false`{:.logic.block}).

{:id="Ball.PaintColor" .color} *PaintColor*
: The color of the `Ball`.

{:id="Ball.Radius" .number} *Radius*
: The distance from the center of the `Ball` to its edge.

{:id="Ball.Speed" .number} *Speed*
: The speed at which the `Ball` moves. The `Ball` moves this many pixels every
 [`Interval`](#Ball.Interval) milliseconds if [`Enabled`](#Ball.Enabled) is `true`{:.logic.block}.

{:id="Ball.Visible" .boolean} *Visible*
: Sets whether sprite should be visible.

{:id="Ball.X" .number} *X*
: The horizontal coordinate of the `Ball`, increasing as the `Ball` moves right. If the property
 [`OriginAtCenter`](#Ball.OriginAtCenter) is true, the coordinate is for the center of the `Ball`;
 otherwise, it is for the leftmost point of the `Ball`.

{:id="Ball.Y" .number} *Y*
: The vertical coordinate of the `Ball`, increasing as the `Ball` moves down. If the property
 [`OriginAtCenter`](#Ball.OriginAtCenter) is true, the coordinate is for the center of the `Ball`
 otherwise, it is for the uppermost point of the `Ball`.

{:id="Ball.Z" .number} *Z*
: How the Ball should be layered relative to other Balls and ImageSprites, with higher-numbered layers in front of lower-numbered layers.

### Events  {#Ball-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="Ball.CollidedWith"} CollidedWith(*other*{:.component})
: Event handler called when two enabled sprites ([`Ball`](#Ball)s or [`ImageSprite`](#ImageSprite)s)
 collide. Note that checking for collisions with a rotated `ImageSprite` currently
 checks against its unrotated position. Therefore, collision
 checking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that are
 rotated.

{:id="Ball.Dragged"} Dragged(*startX*{:.number},*startY*{:.number},*prevX*{:.number},*prevY*{:.number},*currentX*{:.number},*currentY*{:.number})
: Event handler for Dragged events.  On all calls, the starting coordinates
 are where the screen was first touched, and the "current" coordinates
 describe the endpoint of the current line segment.  On the first call
 within a given drag, the "previous" coordinates are the same as the
 starting coordinates; subsequently, they are the "current" coordinates
 from the prior call. Note that the `Ball` won't actually move
 anywhere in response to the Dragged event unless
 [`MoveTo`](#Ball.MoveTo) is specifically called.

{:id="Ball.EdgeReached"} EdgeReached(*edge*{:.number})
: Event handler called when the `Ball` reaches an `edge`{:.variable.block} of the screen.
 If [`Bounce`](#Ball.Bounce) is then called with that edge, the sprite will appear to bounce off
 of the edge it reached. Edge here is represented as an integer that indicates one of eight
 directions north(1), northeast(2), east(3), southeast(4), south (-1), southwest(-2), west(-3),
 and northwest(-4).

{:id="Ball.Flung"} Flung(*x*{:.number},*y*{:.number},*speed*{:.number},*heading*{:.number},*xvel*{:.number},*yvel*{:.number})
: When a fling gesture (quick swipe) is made on the sprite: provides
 the (x,y) position of the start of the fling, relative to the upper
 left of the canvas. Also provides the speed (pixels per millisecond) and heading
 (-180 to 180 degrees) of the fling, as well as the x velocity and y velocity
 components of the fling's vector.

{:id="Ball.NoLongerCollidingWith"} NoLongerCollidingWith(*other*{:.component})
: Event indicating that a pair of sprites are no longer colliding.

{:id="Ball.TouchDown"} TouchDown(*x*{:.number},*y*{:.number})
: When the user begins touching the sprite (places finger on sprite and
 leaves it there): provides the (x,y) position of the touch, relative
 to the upper left of the canvas

{:id="Ball.TouchUp"} TouchUp(*x*{:.number},*y*{:.number})
: When the user stops touching the sprite (lifts finger after a
 TouchDown event): provides the (x,y) position of the touch, relative
 to the upper left of the canvas.

{:id="Ball.Touched"} Touched(*x*{:.number},*y*{:.number})
: When the user touches the sprite and then immediately lifts finger: provides
 the (x,y) position of the touch, relative to the upper left of the canvas.

### Methods  {#Ball-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="Ball.Bounce" class="method"} <i/> Bounce(*edge*{:.number})

 be the one returned by [`EdgeReached`](#Ball.EdgeReached).

{:id="Ball.CollidingWith" class="method returns boolean"} <i/> CollidingWith(*other*{:.component})
: Indicates whether a collision has been registered between this `Ball`
 and the passed `other` sprite.

{:id="Ball.MoveIntoBounds" class="method"} <i/> MoveIntoBounds()
: Moves the sprite back in bounds if part of it extends out of bounds,
 having no effect otherwise. If the sprite is too wide to fit on the
 canvas, this aligns the left side of the sprite with the left side of the
 canvas. If the sprite is too tall to fit on the canvas, this aligns the
 top side of the sprite with the top side of the canvas.

{:id="Ball.MoveTo" class="method"} <i/> MoveTo(*x*{:.number},*y*{:.number})
: Sets the `x` and `y` coordinates of the `Ball`. If [`OriginAtCenter`](#Ball.OriginAtCenter) is true,
 the center of the `Ball` will be placed here. Otherwise, the top left edge of the `Ball` will
 be placed at the specified coordinates.

{:id="Ball.MoveToPoint" class="method"} <i/> MoveToPoint(*coordinates*{:.list})
: Moves the Ball so that its origin is at the specified x and y coordinates.

{:id="Ball.PointInDirection" class="method"} <i/> PointInDirection(*x*{:.number},*y*{:.number})
: Turns this `Ball` to point toward the point with the coordinates `(x, y)`.

{:id="Ball.PointTowards" class="method"} <i/> PointTowards(*target*{:.component})
: Turns this `Ball` to point towards a given `target` sprite. The new heading will be parallel
 to the line joining the origins of the two sprites.

## Canvas  {#Canvas}

A two-dimensional touch-sensitive rectangular panel on which drawing can
 be done and sprites can be moved.

 The [`BackgroundColor`](#Canvas.BackgroundColor), [`PaintColor`](#Canvas.PaintColor), [`BackgroundImage`](#Canvas.BackgroundImage),
 [`Width`](#Canvas.Width), and [`Height`](#Canvas.Height) of the `Canvas` can be set in either the Designer or in
 the Blocks Editor. The `Width` and `Height` are measured in pixels and must be positive.

 Any location on the `Canvas` can be specified as a pair of `(X, Y)` values, where

 * X is the number of pixels away from the left edge of the `Canvas`
 * Y is the number of pixels away from the top edge of the `Canvas`

 There are events to tell when and where a `Canvas` has been touched or a Sprite
 ([`ImageSprite`](#ImageSprite) or [`Ball`](#Ball)) has been dragged. There are also methods for drawing
 points, lines, circles, shapes, arcs, and text.

## ImageSprite  {#ImageSprite}

A 'sprite' that can be placed on a [`Canvas`](#Canvas), where it can react to touches and drags,
 interact with other sprites ([`Ball`](#Ball)s and other `ImageSprite`s) and the edge of the
 `Canvas`, and move according to its property values. Its appearance is that of the image
 specified in its [`Picture`](#ImageSprite.Picture) property (unless its [`Visible`](#ImageSprite.Visible) property is
 `false`{:.logic.block}.

 To have an `ImageSprite` move 10 pixels to the left every 1000 milliseconds (one second), for
 example, you would set the [`Speed`](#ImageSprite.Speed) property to 10 [pixels], the [`Interval`](#ImageSprite.Interval)
 property to 1000 [milliseconds], the [`Heading`](#ImageSprite.Heading) property to 180 [degrees], and the
 [`Enabled`](#ImageSprite.Enabled) property to `true`{:.logic.block}. A sprite whose [`Rotates`](#ImageSprite.Rotates)
 property is `true`{:.logic.block} will rotate its image as the sprite's heading changes.
 *Checking for collisions with a rotated sprite currently checks the sprite's unrotated position
 so that collision checking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that are
 rotated.* Any of the sprite properties can be changed at any time under program control.



### Properties  {#ImageSprite-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="ImageSprite.Enabled" .boolean} *Enabled*
: Controls whether the `ImageSprite` moves when its speed is non-zero.

{:id="ImageSprite.Heading" .number} *Heading*

 of the screen; 90 degrees is toward the top of the screen.

{:id="ImageSprite.Height" .number .bo} *Height*
: The height of the ImageSprite in pixels.

{:id="ImageSprite.Interval" .number} *Interval*
: The interval in milliseconds at which the `ImageSprite`'s position is updated. For example, if the
 `Interval` is 50 and the [`Speed`](#ImageSprite.Speed) is 10, then the `ImageSprite` will move 10 pixels
 every 50 milliseconds.

{:id="ImageSprite.MarkOrigin" .text .wo} *MarkOrigin*
: Mark the origin of ImageSprite using a draggable marker.

{:id="ImageSprite.OriginX" .number} *OriginX*
: Horizontal unit coordinate of the origin with respect to left edge. Permitted values in [0, 1].

 and 1.0 means the origin is on the right edge.

{:id="ImageSprite.OriginY" .number} *OriginY*
: Vertical unit coordinate of the origin with respect to top edge. Permitted values in [0, 1].
 A value of 0.0 means the origin lies on the top edge, 0.5 means the origin lies in the middle
 and 1.0 means the origin is on the bottom edge.

{:id="ImageSprite.Picture" .text} *Picture*
: Specifies the path of the sprite's picture.

{:id="ImageSprite.Rotates" .boolean} *Rotates*
: If true, the sprite image rotates to match the sprite's heading. If false, the sprite image
 does not rotate when the sprite changes heading. The sprite rotates around its origin.

{:id="ImageSprite.Speed" .number} *Speed*
: The speed at which the `ImageSprite` moves. The `ImageSprite` moves this many pixels every
 [`Interval`](#ImageSprite.Interval) milliseconds if [`Enabled`](#ImageSprite.Enabled) is `true`{:.logic.block}.

{:id="ImageSprite.Visible" .boolean} *Visible*
: Sets whether sprite should be visible.

{:id="ImageSprite.Width" .number .bo} *Width*

: The vertical coordinate of the origin of the ImageSprite, increasing as the ImageSprite moves down.

{:id="ImageSprite.Z" .number} *Z*
: How the ImageSprite should be layered relative to other Balls and ImageSprites, with higher-numbered layers in front of lower-numbered layers.

### Events  {#ImageSprite-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="ImageSprite.CollidedWith"} CollidedWith(*other*{:.component})
: Event handler called when two enabled sprites ([`Ball`](#Ball)s or [`ImageSprite`](#ImageSprite)s)
 collide. Note that checking for collisions with a rotated `ImageSprite` currently
 checks against its unrotated position. Therefore, collision
 checking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that are
 rotated.

 are where the screen was first touched, and the "current" coordinates
 describe the endpoint of the current line segment.  On the first call
 within a given drag, the "previous" coordinates are the same as the
 starting coordinates; subsequently, they are the "current" coordinates
 from the prior call. Note that the `ImageSprite` won't actually move
 anywhere in response to the Dragged event unless
 [`MoveTo`](#ImageSprite.MoveTo) is specifically called.

{:id="ImageSprite.EdgeReached"} EdgeReached(*edge*{:.number})
: Event handler called when the `ImageSprite` reaches an `edge`{:.variable.block} of the screen.
 If [`Bounce`](#ImageSprite.Bounce) is then called with that edge, the sprite will appear to bounce off

 the (x,y) position of the start of the fling, relative to the upper
 left of the canvas. Also provides the speed (pixels per millisecond) and heading
 (-180 to 180 degrees) of the fling, as well as the x velocity and y velocity
 components of the fling's vector.

{:id="ImageSprite.NoLongerCollidingWith"} NoLongerCollidingWith(*other*{:.component})
: Event indicating that a pair of sprites are no longer colliding.

{:id="ImageSprite.TouchDown"} TouchDown(*x*{:.number},*y*{:.number})
