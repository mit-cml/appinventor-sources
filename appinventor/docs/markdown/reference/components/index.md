title: Component Reference
---

This document describes the components you can use in App Inventor to build your apps.

Each component can have methods, events, and properties. Most properties can be changed by apps — these properties have blocks you can use to get and set the values. Some properties can't be changed by apps — these only have blocks you can use to get the values, not set them. Each item is annotated with additional text to indicate the type of the item, whether it is read-only, and whether it only exists in the designer or blocks.
