## Circle  {#Circle}

The `Circle` component visualizes a circle of a given [`Radius`](#Circle.Radius), in meters,
 centered at a [`Latitude`](#Circle.Latitude) and [`Longitude`](#Circle.Longitude). The `Circle`'s appearance
 cnn be customized using properties such as [`FillColor`](#Circle.FillColor), [`StrokeColor`](#Circle.StrokeColor),
 and [`StrokeWidth`](#Circle.StrokeWidth).

 The `Circle` component can also be used to implement features such as geofencing, a mechanism
 where the user's presence within an area is used to trigger other behaviors. Using the
 [`DistanceToPoint`](#Circle.DistanceToPoint) method combined with the
 [`LocationSensor`](sensors.html#LocationSensor), you can determine whether a user's location is
 inside or outside of the `Circle`. You can use this feature to trigger additional actions.



### Properties  {#Circle-Properties}

 completely invisible and a value of 1.0 will be completely opaque.

{:id="Circle.Latitude" .number} *Latitude*
: Sets or gets the latitude of the center of the circle, in degrees. Positive values represent
 north of the equator and negative values represent south of the equator. To update the
 latitude and longitude simultaneously, use the [`SetLocation`](#Circle.SetLocation) method.

{:id="Circle.Longitude" .number} *Longitude*
: Sets or gets the longitude of the center of the circle, in degrees. Positive values represent
 east of the prime meridian and negative values represent west of the prime meridian. To update
 the latitude and longitude simultaneously, use the [`SetLocation`](#Circle.SetLocation) method.

{:id="Circle.Visible" .boolean} *Visible*
: Specifies whether the `Circle` should be visible on the screen.  Value is `true`{:.logic.block}
 if the `Circle` is showing and `false`{:.logic.block} if hidden.

### Events  {#Circle-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="Circle.Click"} Click()
: The `Click` event runs when the user taps on the `Circle`.

{:id="Circle.Drag"} Drag()
: The `Drag` event runs in response to position updates of the `Circle` as the user drags it.

{:id="Circle.LongClick"} LongClick()
: The `LongClick` event runs when the user presses and holds the `Circle` and then releases it.
 This event will only trigger if [`Draggable`](#Circle.Draggable) is `false`{:.logic.block} because it
 uses the same gesture as [`StartDrag`](#Circle.StartDrag).

{:id="Circle.StartDrag"} StartDrag()
: The `StartDrag` event runs when the user presses and holds the `Circle` and then proceeds to
 move their finger on the screen. It will be followed by the [`Drag`](#Circle.Drag) and
 [`StopDrag`](#Circle.StopDrag) events.

{:id="Circle.StopDrag"} StopDrag()
: The `StopDrag` event runs when the user releases the `Circle` at the end of a drag.

### Methods  {#Circle-Methods}

{:.methods}

 `true`{:.logic.block}, the computation is done between the centroids of the two features.
 Otherwise, the distance will be computed between the two features based on the closest points.
 Further, when `centroids` is `false`{:.logic.block}, this method will return 0 if the `Circle`
 intersects or contains the `mapFeature`. If an error occurs, this method will return -1.

{:id="Circle.DistanceToPoint" class="method returns number"} <i/> DistanceToPoint(*latitude*{:.number},*longitude*{:.number},*centroid*{:.boolean})
: Computes the distance between the `Circle` and the given `latitude` and `longitude`. If

## Map  {#Map}

A two-dimensional container that renders map tiles in the background and allows for multiple
 [`Marker`](#Marker) elements to identify points on the map. Map tiles are supplied by OpenStreetMap
 contributors and the the United States Geological Survey.

 The `Map` component provides three utilities for manipulating its boundaries with App Inventor.
 First, a locking mechanism is provided to allow the map to be moved relative to other components
 on the Screen. Second, when unlocked, the user can pan the `Map` to any location. At this new
 location, the &quot;Set Initial Boundary&quot; button can be pressed to save the current `Map`
 coordinates to its properties. Lastly, if the `Map` is moved to a different location, for example
 to add [`Marker`](#Marker)s off-screen, then the &quot;Reset Map to Initial Bounds&quot; button can
 be used to re-center the `Map` at the starting location.



### Properties  {#Map-Properties}

{:.properties}

 [`PanTo`](#Map.PanTo) method.

{:id="Map.MapType" .number} *MapType*
: Sets or gets the tile layer used to draw the Map background. Defaults to Roads. Valid values
 are:

   1. Roads
   2. Aerial
   3. Terrain

   **Note:** Road layers are provided by OpenStreetMap and aerial and terrain layers are
 provided by the U.S. Geological Survey.

{:id="Map.Rotation" .number} *Rotation*
: Specifies the rotation of the map in decimal degrees, if any.

{:id="Map.ScaleUnits" .number} *ScaleUnits*
: Specifies the units used for the scale overlay. 1 (the default) will give metric units
 (km, m) whereas 2 will give imperial units (mi, ft).

{:id="Map.ShowCompass" .boolean} *ShowCompass*
: Specifies whether to a compass overlay on the Map. The compass will be rotated based on the
 device's orientation if a digital compass is present in hardware.

{:id="Map.UserLatitude" .number .ro .bo} *UserLatitude*
: Returns the user's latitude if ShowUser is enabled.

{:id="Map.UserLongitude" .number .ro .bo} *UserLongitude*
: Returns the user's longitude if ShowUser is enabled.

{:id="Map.Visible" .boolean} *Visible*

 of the [`Screen`'s `Width`](userinterface.html#Screen.Width).

{:id="Map.ZoomLevel" .number} *ZoomLevel*
: Specifies the zoom level of the map.
 Valid values of ZoomLevel are dependent on the tile provider and the latitude and
 longitude of the map. For example, zoom levels are more constrained over oceans than dense
 city centers to conserve space for storing tiles, so valid values may be 1-7 over ocean and
 1-20 over cities. Tile providers may send warning or error tiles if the zoom level is too
 great for the server to support.

## Marker  {#Marker}

The `Marker` component indicates points on a [`Map`](#Map), such as buildings or other points of
 interest. `Marker`s can be customized in many ways, such as using custom images from the app's
 assets or by changing the `Marker` [`FillColor`](#Marker.FillColor). `Marker`s can also be created
 dynamically by calling the [`Map`'s `CreateMarker`](#Map.CreateMarker) method and configured using
 the ["Any Component"](../other/any-component-blocks.html) blocks.
