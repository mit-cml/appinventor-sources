## AccelerometerSensor  {#AccelerometerSensor}

Non-visible component that can detect shaking and measure acceleration approximately in three
 dimensions using SI units (m/s<sup>2</sup>). The components are:

 - **xAccel**: 0 when the phone is at rest on a flat surface, positive when the phone is tilted
   to the right (i.e., its left side is raised), and negative when the phone is tilted to the
   left (i.e., its right size is raised).
 - **yAccel**: 0 when the phone is at rest on a flat surface, positive when its bottom is raised,
   and negative when its top is raised.
 - **zAccel**: Equal to -9.8 (earth's gravity in meters per second per second when the device is
   at rest parallel to the ground with the display facing up, 0 when perpendicular to the ground,
   and +9.8 when facing down. The value can also be affected by accelerating it with or against
   gravity.



### Properties  {#AccelerometerSensor-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.Available" .boolean .ro .bo} *Available*
: Returns whether the `AccelerometerSensor` hardware is available on the device.

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.Enabled" .boolean} *Enabled*
: Specifies whether the sensor should generate events.  If `true`{:.logic.block},
 the sensor will generate events.  Otherwise, no events are
 generated even if the device is accelerated or shaken.

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.LegacyMode" .boolean .wo .do} *LegacyMode*
: Prior to the release that added this property the AccelerometerSensor component passed through sensor values directly as received from the Android system. However these values do not compensate for tablets that default to Landscape mode, requiring the MIT App Inventor programmer to compensate. However compensating would result in incorrect results in Portrait mode devices such as phones. We now detect Landscape mode tablets and perform the compensation. However if your project is already compensating for the change, you will now get incorrect results. Although our preferred solution is for you to update your project, you can also just set this property to “true” and our compensation code will be deactivated. Note: We recommend that you update your project as we may remove this property in a future release.

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.MinimumInterval" .number} *MinimumInterval*
: Specifies the minimum interval required between back-to-back [`Shaking`](#AccelerometerSensor.Shaking) events,
 in milliseconds.
 Once the phone starts being shaken, all further [`Shaking`](#AccelerometerSensor.Shaking) events will be ignored
 until the interval has elapsed.

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.Sensitivity" .number} *Sensitivity*
: Specifies the sensitivity of the accelerometer. Valid values are: `1` (weak), `2` (moderate),
 and `3` (strong).

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.XAccel" .number .ro .bo} *XAccel*
: Returns the acceleration in the X-dimension in SI units (m/s²).
 The sensor must be enabled to return meaningful values.

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.YAccel" .number .ro .bo} *YAccel*
: Returns the acceleration in the Y-dimension in SI units (m/s²).
 The sensor must be enabled to return meaningful values.

{:id="AccelerometerSensor.ZAccel" .number .ro .bo} *ZAccel*
: Returns the acceleration in the Z-dimension in SI units (m/s²).
 The sensor must be enabled to return meaningful values.

### Events  {#AccelerometerSensor-Events}

## Clock  {#Clock}

![Image of the Clock component](images/clock.png)

 Non-visible component that provides the instant in time using the internal clock on the phone.
 It can fire a timer at regularly set intervals and perform time calculations, manipulations,
 and conversions.

 Operations on dates and times, such as from [`DatePicker`](userinterface.html#DatePicker) and
 [`TimePicker`](userinterface.html#TimePicker), are accomplished through methods in Clock. Date
 and Time are represented as InstantInTime and Duration.

  - **Instant**: consists of Year, Month, DayOfMnoth, Hour, Minute, and SEcond. An instant can be
    created using the [`MakeInstant`](#Clock.MakeInstant), [`MakeInstantFromMillis`](#Clock.MakeInstantFromMillis) and
    [`MakeInstantFromParts`](#Clock.MakeInstantFromParts) methods.
  - **Duration**: time in milliseconds elapsed between instants. Duration can be obtained by the
    [`Duration`](#Clock.Duration) method.

 Instants are assumed to be in the device's local time zone. When they are converted to or from
 milliseconds, the milliseconds for a given Instance are calculated from January 1, 1970 in UTC
 (Greenwich Mean Time).

 Methods to convert an Instant to text are also available. Acceptable patterns are empty string,
 `MM/dd/YYYY HH:mm:ss a`, or `MMM d, yyyy HH:mm`. The empty string will provide the default
 format, which is `"MMM d, yyyy HH:mm:ss a"` for [`FormatDateTime`](#Clock.FormatDateTime),
 `"MMM d, yyyy"` for [`FormatDate`](#Clock.FormatDate). To see all possible formats, please
 see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).

 A note on combining date and time: In order to combine the date from one Instant and the time
 from another, for example from a [`DatePicker`](userinterface.html#DatePicker) and
 [`TimePicker`](userinterface.html#TimePicker), extract the parts as text and use the text to
 create a new Instant. For example:

 ![Example code blocks to combine date and time picker data](images/date_and_time_instant.png)

## LocationSensor  {#LocationSensor}

Non-visible component providing location information, including [`Latitude`](#LocationSensor.Latitude),
 [`Longitude`](#LocationSensor.Longitude), [`Altitude`](#LocationSensor.Altitude) (if supported by the device), speed (if supported by
 the device), and address. This can also perform "geocoding", converting a given address (not
 necessarily the current one) to a latitude (with the [`LatitudeFromAddress`](#LocationSensor.LatitudeFromAddress)
 method) and a longitude (with the [`LongitudeFromAddress`](#LocationSensor.LongitudeFromAddress) method).

 In order to function, the component must have its [`Enabled`](#LocationSensor.Enabled) property set to
 `true`{:.logic.block}, and the device must have location sensing enabled through wireless
 networks or GPS satellites (if outdoors).

 Location information might not be immediately available when an app starts. You'll have to wait
 a short time for a location provider to be found and used, or wait for the
 [`LocationChanged`](#LocationSensor.LocationChanged) event.

 The emulator does not emulate sensors on all devices. Code should be tested on a physical device.



### Properties  {#LocationSensor-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="LocationSensor.Accuracy" .number .ro .bo} *Accuracy*
: The `LocationSensor` will be able to locate the device with a varying degree of confidence,
 based on the quality of satellite, cell towers, and other data used to estimate location.
 The `Accuracy` value is the radius in meters around the sensor's detected location. The device
 has a 68% chance to be located within this radius. More precise location detection will result
 in a smaller accuracy number, which allows the app to have more confidence where the device
 is actually located.

   If the accuracy is not known, the return value is 0.0

{:id="LocationSensor.Altitude" .number .ro .bo} *Altitude*
: Altitude of the device measured in meters, if available.

   Altitude is measured from the
 [World Geodetic System 84 reference ellipsoid](https://gisgeography.com/wgs84-world-geodetic-system/),
 not sea level.

   Note that it is difficult for devices to accurately sense altitude. Altitude reported on a
 phone/tablet can easily be off by 30 meters or more.

{:id="LocationSensor.AvailableProviders" .list .ro .bo} *AvailableProviders*
: List of available service providers, such as gps or network. This information is provided
 as a list and in text form.

{:id="LocationSensor.CurrentAddress" .text .ro .bo} *CurrentAddress*
: Physical street address of the device from Google's map database.

   The address might not always be available from the provider, and the address reported may not
 always be of the building where the device is located.

   If Google has no address information available for a particular location, this will return
 `No address available`.

{:id="LocationSensor.DistanceInterval" .number} *DistanceInterval*
: Determines the minimum distance interval, in meters, that the sensor will try to use for
 sending out location updates. For example, if this is set to 50, then the sensor will fire a
 [`LocationChanged`](#LocationSensor.LocationChanged) event only after 50 meters have been
 traversed. However, the sensor does not guarantee that an update will be received at exactly
 the distance interval. It may take more than 5 meters to fire an event, for instance.

   It is also useful to check against [`Accuracy`](#LocationSensor.Accuracy) when using this property. When your
 device is moving, the accuracy of the detected location is constantly changing.

{:id="LocationSensor.Enabled" .boolean} *Enabled*
: If `true`{:.logic.block}, the `LocationSensor` will attempt to read location information from
 GPS, WiFi location, or other means available on the device. This setting does not control
 whether location information is actually available. Device location must be enabled or
 disabled in the device settings.

{:id="LocationSensor.HasAccuracy" .boolean .ro .bo} *HasAccuracy*
: If `true`{:.logic.block}, the device can report its accuracy level.

{:id="LocationSensor.HasAltitude" .boolean .ro .bo} *HasAltitude*
: If `true`{:.logic.block}, the device can report its altitude.

{:id="LocationSensor.HasLongitudeLatitude" .boolean .ro .bo} *HasLongitudeLatitude*
: If `true`{:.logic.block}, the device can report longitude and latitude.  It is
 always the case that either both or neither are.

{:id="LocationSensor.Latitude" .number .ro .bo} *Latitude*
: The most recently available latitude value in degrees reported to 5 decimal places.
 If no value is available, 0 will be returned.
 Latitude is a value between 90 (north) and -90 (south), where 0 marks the Equator.

{:id="LocationSensor.Longitude" .number .ro .bo} *Longitude*
: The most recent available longitude value in degrees reported to 5 decimal places.
 If no value is available, 0 will be returned.
 Longitude is a value between 180 (east) and -180 (west), where 0 marks the Prime Meridian.

{:id="LocationSensor.ProviderLocked" .boolean .bo} *ProviderLocked*
: The device will not change the service provider.

   It is possible for a device to switch service providers when the current provider is unable
 to provide adequate location information. `ProviderLocked` is a Boolean value: true/false.
 Set to `true`{:.logic.block} to prevent providers from changing. Set to `false`{:.logic.block}
 to allow for automatic switching when necessary.

{:id="LocationSensor.ProviderName" .text .bo} *ProviderName*
: The current service provider. The provider will most likely be either GPS or network.

{:id="LocationSensor.TimeInterval" .number} *TimeInterval*
: Determines the minimum time interval, in milliseconds, that the sensor will try to use for
 sending out location updates. However, location updates will only be received when the
 location of the phone actually changes, and use of the specified time interval is not
 guaranteed. For example, if 30000 is used as the time interval, location updates will never
 be fired sooner than 30000ms, but they may be fired anytime after.

   Values smaller than 30000ms (30 seconds) are not practical for most devices. Small values
 may drain battery and overwork the GPS.

### Events  {#LocationSensor-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="LocationSensor.LocationChanged"} LocationChanged(*latitude*{:.number},*longitude*{:.number},*altitude*{:.number},*speed*{:.number})
: Indicates that a new location has been detected. Speed is reported in meters/second
 Other values match their properties.

{:id="LocationSensor.StatusChanged"} StatusChanged(*provider*{:.text},*status*{:.text})
: Indicates that the status of the location provider service has changed, such as when a
 provider is lost or a new provider starts being used.

### Methods  {#LocationSensor-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="LocationSensor.LatitudeFromAddress" class="method returns number"} <i/> LatitudeFromAddress(*locationName*{:.text})
: Derives latitude from the given `locationName`.

{:id="LocationSensor.LongitudeFromAddress" class="method returns number"} <i/> LongitudeFromAddress(*locationName*{:.text})
: Derives longitude from the given `locationName`.

## OrientationSensor  {#OrientationSensor}

![Example of the OrientationSensor icon](images/orientationsensor.png)

 Use an orientation sensor component to determine the phone's spatial orientation.

 An orientation sensor is a non-visible component that reports the following three values, in
 degrees:

  - **Roll** : 0 degree when the device is level, increasing to 90 degrees as the device is
    tilted up onto its left side, and decreasing to −90 degrees when the device is tilted up onto
    its right side.
  - **Pitch** : 0 degree when the device is level, increasing to 90 degrees as the device is
    tilted so its top is pointing down, then decreasing to 0 degree as it gets turned over.
    Similarly, as the device is tilted so its bottom points down, pitch decreases to −90 degrees,
    then increases to 0 degree as it gets turned all the way over.
  - **Azimuth** : 0 degree when the top of the device is pointing north, 90 degrees when it is
    pointing east, 180 degrees when it is pointing south, 270 degrees when it is pointing west,
    etc.

 These measurements assume that the device itself is not moving.

## Pedometer  {#Pedometer}

This component keeps count of steps using the accelerometer.



### Properties  {#Pedometer-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="Pedometer.Distance" .number .ro .bo} *Distance*
: Returns the approximate distance traveled in meters.

{:id="Pedometer.ElapsedTime" .number .ro .bo} *ElapsedTime*
: Returns the time elapsed in milliseconds since the pedometer has started.

{:id="Pedometer.SimpleSteps" .number .ro .bo} *SimpleSteps*
: Returns the number of simple steps taken since the pedometer has started.

{:id="Pedometer.StopDetectionTimeout" .number} *StopDetectionTimeout*
: Returns the duration of idleness (no steps detected) after which to go into a "stopped" state.

{:id="Pedometer.StrideLength" .number} *StrideLength*
: Returns the current estimate of stride length in meters, if calibrated, or returns the
 default (0.73 m) otherwise.

{:id="Pedometer.WalkSteps" .number .ro .bo} *WalkSteps*
: Returns the number of walk steps taken since the pedometer has started.

### Events  {#Pedometer-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="Pedometer.SimpleStep"} SimpleStep(*simpleSteps*{:.number},*distance*{:.number})
: This event is run when a raw step is detected.

{:id="Pedometer.WalkStep"} WalkStep(*walkSteps*{:.number},*distance*{:.number})
: This event is run when a walking step is detected. A walking step is a step that appears to be involved in forward motion.

### Methods  {#Pedometer-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="Pedometer.Reset" class="method"} <i/> Reset()
: Resets the step counter, distance measure and time running.

{:id="Pedometer.Save" class="method"} <i/> Save()
: Saves the pedometer state to the phone. Permits permits accumulation of steps and distance between invocations of an App that uses the pedometer. Different Apps will have their own saved state.

{:id="Pedometer.Start" class="method"} <i/> Start()
: Starts the pedometer.

{:id="Pedometer.Stop" class="method"} <i/> Stop()
: Stops the pedometer.

## ProximitySensor  {#ProximitySensor}

A sensor component that can measure the proximity of an object (in cm) relative to the view
 screen of a device. This sensor is typically used to determine whether a handset is being held
 up to a persons ear; i.e. lets you determine how far away an object is from a device. Many
 devices return the absolute distance, in cm, but some return only near and far values. In this
 case, the sensor usually reports its maximum range value in the far state and a lesser value
 in the near state. It reports the following value:

   - **Distance**: The distance from the object to the device



### Properties  {#ProximitySensor-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="ProximitySensor.Available" .boolean .ro .bo} *Available*
: Reports whether or not the device has a proximity sensor.

{:id="ProximitySensor.Distance" .number .ro .bo} *Distance*
: Returns the distance from the object to the device.
 The sensor must be enabled to return meaningful values.

{:id="ProximitySensor.Enabled" .boolean} *Enabled*
: If true, the sensor will generate events.  Otherwise, no events
 are generated.

{:id="ProximitySensor.KeepRunningWhenOnPause" .boolean} *KeepRunningWhenOnPause*
: Returns value of keepRunningWhenOnPause.

{:id="ProximitySensor.MaximumRange" .number .ro .bo} *MaximumRange*
: Determines a sensor's maximum range. Some proximity sensors return binary values
 that represent "near" or "far." In this case, the sensor usually reports
 its maximum range value in the far state and a lesser value in the near state.
 Typically, the far value is a value > 5 cm, but this can vary from sensor to sensor.

### Events  {#ProximitySensor-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="ProximitySensor.ProximityChanged"} ProximityChanged(*distance*{:.number})
: Triggered when distance (in cm) of the object to the device changes.

### Methods  {#ProximitySensor-Methods}

{:.methods}
None


## Thermometer  {#Thermometer}

Physical world component that can measure the ambient air temperature if
 supported by the hardware.



### Properties  {#Thermometer-Properties}
