 [`AfterGettingText`](#SpeechRecognizer.AfterGettingText) may get several calls with `partial` set to `true`{:.logic.block}.
 Once sufficient time has elapsed since the last utterance, or `StopListening` is called,
 the last string will be returned with `partial` set to `false`{:.logic.block} to indicate that it is the
 final recognized string and no more data will be provided until recognition is again started. See
 [`AfterGettingText`](#SpeechRecognizer.AfterGettingText) for more details on partial speech recognition.

### Events  {#SpeechRecognizer-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="SpeechRecognizer.AfterGettingText"} AfterGettingText(*result*{:.text},*partial*{:.boolean})
: Simple event to raise after the SpeechRecognizer has recognized speech. If
 [`UseLegacy`](#SpeechRecognizer.UseLegacy) is `true`{:.logic.block}, then this event will only happen once
 at the very end of the recognition. If [`UseLegacy`](#SpeechRecognizer.UseLegacy) is `false`{:.logic.block},
 then this event will run multiple times as the `SpeechRecognizer` incrementally recognizes
 speech. In this case, `partial` will be `true`{:.logic.block} until the recognized speech
 has been finalized (e.g., the user has stopped speaking), in which case `partial` will be
 `false`{:.logic.block}.

{:id="SpeechRecognizer.BeforeGettingText"} BeforeGettingText()
: Simple event to raise when the `SpeechRecognizer` is invoked but before its
 activity is started.

### Methods  {#SpeechRecognizer-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="SpeechRecognizer.GetText" class="method"} <i/> GetText()
: Asks the user to speak, and converts the speech to text. Signals the
 [`AfterGettingText`](#SpeechRecognizer.AfterGettingText) event when the result is available.

{:id="SpeechRecognizer.Stop" class="method"} <i/> Stop()
: Function used to forcefully stop listening speech in cases where
 SpeechRecognizer cannot stop automatically.
 This function works only when the [`UseLegacy`](#SpeechRecognizer.UseLegacy) property is
 set to `false`{:.logic.block}.

## TextToSpeech  {#TextToSpeech}

The `TextToSpeech` component speaks a given text aloud. You can set the pitch
 and the rate of speech.

 You can also set a language by supplying a language code. This changes the pronunciation of
 words, not the actual language spoken. For example, setting the [`Language`](#TextToSpeech.Language) to French
 and speaking English text will sound like someone speaking English (en) with a French accent.

 You can also specify a country by supplying a [`Country`](#TextToSpeech.Country) code. This can affect the
 pronunciation. For example, British English (GBR) will sound different from US English (USA).
 Not every country code will affect every language.

 The languages and countries available depend on the particular device, and can be listed with
 the [`AvailableLanguages`](#TextToSpeech.AvailableLanguages) and [`AvailableCountries`](#TextToSpeech.AvailableCountries) properties.



### Properties  {#TextToSpeech-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="TextToSpeech.AvailableCountries" .list .ro .bo} *AvailableCountries*

: List of the languages available on this device for use with TextToSpeech.  Check the Android developer documentation under supported languages to find the meanings of these abbreviations.

{:id="TextToSpeech.Country" .text} *Country*
: Country code to use for speech generation. This can affect the pronunciation. For example,
 British English (GBR) will sound different from US English (USA). Not every country code will
 affect every language.

{:id="TextToSpeech.Language" .text} *Language*
: Sets the language for TextToSpeech. This changes the way that words are pronounced, not the
 actual language that is spoken. For example, setting the language to French and speaking
 English text will sound like someone speaking English with a French accent.

{:id="TextToSpeech.Pitch" .number} *Pitch*
: Sets the speech pitch for the TextToSpeech.

   The values should be between 0 and 2 where lower values lower the tone of synthesized voice
 and greater values raise it.

   The default value is 1.0 for normal pitch.

{:id="TextToSpeech.Result" .boolean .ro .bo} *Result*
: Returns `true`{:.logic.block} if the text was successfully converted to
 speech, otherwise `false`{:.logic.block}.

{:id="TextToSpeech.SpeechRate" .number} *SpeechRate*
: Sets the SpeechRate for TextToSpeech.

   The values should be between 0 and 2 where lower values slow down the pitch and greater
 values accelerate it.

   The default value is 1.0 for normal speech rate.

### Events  {#TextToSpeech-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="TextToSpeech.AfterSpeaking"} AfterSpeaking(*result*{:.boolean})
: Event to raise after the message is spoken. The `result`{:.variable.block} will be
 `true`{:.logic.block} if the message is spoken successfully, otherwise it will be
 `false`{:.logic.block}.

: Event to raise when Speak is invoked, before the message is spoken.

### Methods  {#TextToSpeech-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="TextToSpeech.Speak" class="method"} <i/> Speak(*message*{:.text})
: Speaks the given message.

{:id="TextToSpeech.Stop" class="method"} <i/> Stop()
: Stops any current speech.

## Translator  {#Translator}

Use this component to translate words and sentences between
 different languages. This component needs Internet access, as it
 will request translations from a server at MIT (which in turn will
 request translations from a commercial translation service).
 Specify the source and target language in the form source-target
 using two letter language codes.  So "en-es" will translate from
 English to Spanish while "es-ru" will translate from Spanish to
 Russian. If you leave out the source language, the service will
 attempt to detect the source language. So providing just "es" will
 attempt to detect the source language and translate it to Spanish.

 **Note:** Translation happens asynchronously in the background. When the translation is complete,
 the [`GotTranslation`](#Translator.GotTranslation) event is triggered.



### Properties  {#Translator-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="Translator.ApiKey" .text .wo} *ApiKey*
: The API Key to use. MIT App Inventor will automatically fill this
 value in. You should not need to change it.

### Events  {#Translator-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="Translator.GotTranslation"} GotTranslation(*responseCode*{:.text},*translation*{:.text})
: Event indicating that a request has finished and has returned data (translation).

### Methods  {#Translator-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="Translator.RequestTranslation" class="method"} <i/> RequestTranslation(*languageToTranslateTo*{:.text},*textToTranslate*{:.text})
: By providing a target language to translate to (for instance, 'es' for Spanish, 'en' for
 English, or 'ru' for Russian), and a word or sentence to translate, this method will request
 a translation. Once the text is translated by the external
 service, the event [`GotTranslation`](#Translator.GotTranslation) will be executed.

   **Note:** Translator will attempt to detect the source language. You can also specify
 prepending it to the language translation, e.g., es-ru will specify Spanish to Russian
 translation.

## VideoPlayer  {#VideoPlayer}

A multimedia component capable of playing videos. When the application is run, the `VideoPlayer`
 will be displayed as a rectangle on-screen. If the user touches the rectangle, controls will
 appear to play/pause, skip ahead, and skip backward within the video. The application can also
 control behavior by calling the [`Start`](#VideoPlayer.Start), [`Pause`](#VideoPlayer.Pause), and [`SeekTo`](#VideoPlayer.SeekTo)
 methods.

 Video files should be in 3GPP (.3gp) or MPEG-4 (.mp4) formats. For more details about legal
 formats, see
 [Android Supported Media Formats](//developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html).

 App Inventor only permits video files under 1 MB and limits the total size of an application to
 5 MB, not all of which is available for media (video, audio, and sound) files. If your media
 files are too large, you may get errors when packaging or installing your application, in which
 case you should reduce the number of media files or their sizes. Most video editing software,
 such as Windows Movie Maker and Apple iMovie, can help you decrease the size of videos by
 shortening them or re-encoding the video into a more compact format.

 You can also set the media source to a URL that points to a streaming video, but the URL must
 point to the video file itself, not to a program that plays the video.

: Seeks to the requested time (specified in milliseconds) in the video. If the video is paused, the frame shown will not be updated by the seek. The player can jump only to key frames in the video, so seeking to times that differ by short intervals may not actually move to different frames.

{:id="VideoPlayer.Start" class="method"} <i/> Start()
: Plays the media specified by the [`Source`](#VideoPlayer.Source).

{:id="VideoPlayer.Stop" class="method"} <i/> Stop()
: Resets to start of video and pauses it if video was playing.
