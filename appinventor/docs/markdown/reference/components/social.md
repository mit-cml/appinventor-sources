## ContactPicker  {#ContactPicker}

A button that, when clicked on, displays a list of the contacts to choose among. After the user
 has made a selection, the following properties will be set to information about the chosen
 contact:

  - [`ContactName`](#ContactPicker.ContactName): the contact's name
  - [`EmailAddress`](#ContactPicker.EmailAddress): the contact's primary email address
  - [`EmailAddressList`](#ContactPicker.EmailAddressList): a list of the contact's email addresses
  - [`ContactUri`](#ContactPicker.ContactUri): the contact's URI on the device
  - [`PhoneNumber`](#ContactPicker.PhoneNumber): the contact's primary phone number (on Later Android Verisons)
  - [`PhoneNumberList`](#ContactPicker.PhoneNumberList): a list of the contact's phone numbers (on Later Android Versions)
  - [`Picture`](#ContactPicker.Picture): the name of the file containing the contact's image, which can be used as a Picture property value for the Image or ImageSprite component.

 Other properties affect the appearance of the button ([`TextAlignment`](#ContactPicker.TextAlignment),
 [`BackgroundColor`](#ContactPicker.BackgroundColor), etc.) and whether it can be clicked on ([`Enabled`](#ContactPicker.Enabled)).

 The `ContactPicker` component might not work on all phones. For example, on Android systems
 before system 3.0, it cannot pick phone numbers, and the list of email addresses will contain
 only one email.

## EmailPicker  {#EmailPicker}

An `EmailPicker` is a kind of text box. If the user begins entering the name or email address of
 a contact, the phone will show a dropdown menu of choices that complete the entry. If there are
 many contacts, the dropdown can take several seconds to appear, and can show intermediate
 results while the matches are being computed.

 The initial contents of the text box and the contents< after user entry is in the [`Text`](#EmailPicker.Text)
 property. If the [`Text`](#EmailPicker.Text) property is initially empty, the contents of the [`Hint`](#EmailPicker.Hint)
 property will be faintly shown in the text box as a hint to the user.

 Other properties affect the appearance of the text box ([`TextAlignment`](#EmailPicker.TextAlignment),
 [`BackgroundColor`](#EmailPicker.BackgroundColor), etc.) and whether it can be used ([`Enabled`](#EmailPicker.Enabled)).

 Text boxes like this are usually used with [`Button`](userinterface.html#Button) components, with
 the user clicking on the button when text entry is complete.

## PhoneCall  {#PhoneCall}

![PhoneCall component icon](images/phonecall.png)

 A non-visible component that makes a phone call to the number specified in the
 [`PhoneNumber`](#PhoneCall.PhoneNumber) property, which can be set either in the Designer or Blocks Editor.
 The component has a [`MakePhoneCall`](#PhoneCall.MakePhoneCall) method, enabling the program to launch a phone call.
 You may also use [`MakePhoneCallDirect`](#PhoneCall.MakePhoneCallDirect) to directly initiate a phone call without user
 interaction. However, apps using this block may require further review by Google if submitted
 to the Play Store so it is advised to use [`MakePhoneCall`](#PhoneCall.MakePhoneCall) instead.

 Often, this component is used with the [`ContactPicker`](#ContactPicker) component, which lets the user
 select a contact from the ones stored on the phone and sets the
 [`PhoneNumber`](#PhoneCall.PhoneNumber) property to [`ContactPicker`'s `PhoneNumber`](#ContactPicker.PhoneNumber) property.

 To directly specify the phone number (e.g., 650-555-1212), set the [`PhoneNumber`](#PhoneCall.PhoneNumber)
 property to a Text with the specified digits (e.g., "6505551212"). Dashes, dots, and parentheses
 may be included (e.g., "(650)-555-1212") but will be ignored; spaces may not be included.



### Properties  {#PhoneCall-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="PhoneCall.PhoneNumber" .text} *PhoneNumber*
: Specifies the phone number to call.

### Events  {#PhoneCall-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="PhoneCall.IncomingCallAnswered"} IncomingCallAnswered(*phoneNumber*{:.text})
: Event indicating that an incoming phone call is answered. `phoneNumber`{:.variable.block} is
 the incoming call phone number.

{:id="PhoneCall.PhoneCallEnded"} PhoneCallEnded(*status*{:.number},*phoneNumber*{:.text})
: Event indicating that a phone call has ended. The `status`{:.variable.block} can be any of:

   - `1`: Incoming call was missed or rejected
   - `2`: Incoming call was answered and hung up
   - `3`: Outgoing call was hung up.

{:id="PhoneCall.PhoneCallStarted"} PhoneCallStarted(*status*{:.number},*phoneNumber*{:.text})
: Event indicating that a phone call has started. The `status`{:.variable.block} can be any of:

   - `1`: Incoming call is ringing
   - `2`: Outgoing call is dialled

### Methods  {#PhoneCall-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="PhoneCall.MakePhoneCall" class="method"} <i/> MakePhoneCall()
: Launches the default dialer app set to start a phone call using the number in the
 [`PhoneNumber`](#PhoneCall.PhoneNumber) property.

{:id="PhoneCall.MakePhoneCallDirect" class="method"} <i/> MakePhoneCallDirect()
: Directly initiates a phone call using the number in the [`PhoneNumber`](#PhoneCall.PhoneNumber) property,
 bypassing user interaction to start the call. **Most apps should use
 [`MakePhoneCall`](#PhoneCall.MakePhoneCall) instead, which requires no permissions.**

## PhoneNumberPicker  {#PhoneNumberPicker}

A button that, when clicked on, displays a list of the contacts' phone numbers to choose among.

## Sharing  {#Sharing}

Sharing is a non-visible component that enables sharing files and/or messages between your app
 and other apps installed on a device. The component will display a list of the installed apps
 that can handle the information provided, and will allow the user to choose one to share the
 content with, for instance a mail app, a social network app, a texting app, and so on.

 The file path can be taken directly from other components such as the
 [`Camera`](media.html#Camera) or the [`ImagePicker`](media.html#ImagePicker), but can also be
 specified directly to read from storage. The default behaviour is to share files from the private
 data directory associated with your app. If the file path starts with a slash (`/`), then the file
 relative to `/` is shared.
 
 Be aware that different devices treat storage differently, so a few things to try if, for
 instance, you have a file called `arrow.gif` in the folder `Appinventor/assets`, would be:

 - `"file:///sdcard/Appinventor/assets/arrow.gif"`; or
 - `"/storage/Appinventor/assets/arrow.gif"`



### Properties  {#Sharing-Properties}

{:.properties}
None


### Events  {#Sharing-Events}

{:.events}
None


### Methods  {#Sharing-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="Sharing.ShareFile" class="method"} <i/> ShareFile(*file*{:.text})
: Shares a file through any capable application installed on the phone by displaying a list of the available apps and allowing the user to choose one from the list. The selected app will open with the file inserted on it.

{:id="Sharing.ShareFileWithMessage" class="method"} <i/> ShareFileWithMessage(*file*{:.text},*message*{:.text})
: Shares both a file and a message through any capable application installed on the phone by displaying a list of available apps and allowing the user to  choose one from the list. The selected app will open with the file and message inserted on it.

{:id="Sharing.ShareMessage" class="method"} <i/> ShareMessage(*message*{:.text})
: Shares a message through any capable application installed on the phone by displaying a list of the available apps and allowing the user to choose one from the list. The selected app will open with the message inserted on it.

## Texting  {#Texting}

![Texting component icon](images/texting.png)

 A component that will, when the [`SendMessage`](#Texting.SendMessage) method is called, launch the device's
 preferred texting app to send the text message specified in the [`SendMessage`](#Texting.SendMessage) property
 to the phone number specified in the [`PhoneNumber`](#Texting.PhoneNumber) property. You may also send text
 messages without user interaction by calling [`SendMessageDirect`](#Texting.SendMessageDirect) instead, but this
 adds dangerous permissions to your final app.

 If the [`ReceivingEnabled`](#Texting.ReceivingEnabled) property is set to 1 messages will not be received. If
 [`ReceivingEnabled`](#Texting.ReceivingEnabled) is set to 2 messages will be received only when the application is
 running. Finally if [`ReceivingEnabled`](#Texting.ReceivingEnabled) is set to 3, messages will be received when the
 application is running and when the application is not running they will be queued and a
 notification displayed to the user.

 When a message arrives, the [`MessageReceived`](#Texting.MessageReceived) event is raised and
 provides the sending number and message.

 An app that includes this component will receive messages even when it is in the background
 (i.e. when it's not visible on the screen) and, moreso, even if the app is not running, so long
 as it's installed on the phone. If the phone receives a text message when the app is not in the
 foreground, the phone will show a notification in the notification bar. Selecting the
 notification will bring up the app. As an app developer, you'll probably want to give your users
 the ability to control ReceivingEnabled so that they can make the phone ignore text messages.

 If the [`GoogleVoiceEnabled`](#Texting.GoogleVoiceEnabled) property is true, messages can be sent over Wifi using
 Google Voice. This option requires that the user have a Google Voice account and that the mobile
 Voice app is installed on the phone. The Google Voice option works only on phones that support
 Android 2.0 (Eclair) or higher. **Unfortunately, receiving no longer works in Google Voice due to
 changes introduced in Google Voice App.**

 To specify the phone number (e.g., 650-555-1212), set the PhoneNumber property to a Text string
 with the specified digits (e.g., 6505551212). Dashes, dots, and parentheses may be included
 (e.g., (650)-555-1212) but will be ignored; spaces may not be included.

 Another way for an app to specify a phone number would be to include a [`PhoneNumberPicker`](#PhoneNumberPicker)
 component, which lets the users select a phone numbers from the ones stored in the the phone's
 contacts.



### Properties  {#Texting-Properties}

{:.properties}

{:id="Texting.GoogleVoiceEnabled" .boolean} *GoogleVoiceEnabled*
: If this property is true, then SendMessage will attempt to send messages over
 WiFi, using Google voice.

{:id="Texting.Message" .text} *Message*
: The message that will be sent when the [`SendMessage`](#Texting.SendMessage) method is called.
 The maximum length of a standard SMS message is usually 170. It may be less for languages
 using diacritical marks.

{:id="Texting.PhoneNumber" .text} *PhoneNumber*
: The number that the message will be sent to when the SendMessage method is called.  The 
 number is a text string with the specified digits (e.g., 6505551212).  Dashes, dots, 
 and parentheses may be included (e.g., (650)-555-1212) but will be ignored; spaces
 should not be included.

{:id="Texting.ReceivingEnabled" .number} *ReceivingEnabled*
: If set to 1 (OFF) no messages will be received. If set to 2 (FOREGROUND) or 3 (ALWAYS) the
 component will respond to messages if it is running. In the case of 2 (FOREGROUND), messages
 received while the app is not running are discarded. In the case of 3 (ALWAYS), messages
 receive while the app is not running will show a notification. Selecting the notification
 will bring up the app and signal the [`MessageReceived`](#Texting.MessageReceived) event. Messages
 received when the app is dormant will be queued, and so several
 [`MessageReceived`](#Texting.MessageReceived) events might appear when the app awakens. As an app
 developer, it would be a good idea to give your users control over this property, so they can
 make their phones ignore text messages when your app is installed.

### Events  {#Texting-Events}

{:.events}

{:id="Texting.MessageReceived"} MessageReceived(*number*{:.text},*messageText*{:.text})
: Event that's raised when a text message is received by the phone. **Using this block will add
 [dangerous permissions](//developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#dangerous_permissions)
 that will require additional approval if your app is submitted to the Google Play Store.**

### Methods  {#Texting-Methods}

{:.methods}

{:id="Texting.SendMessage" class="method"} <i/> SendMessage()
: Launch the phone's default text messaging app with the message and phone number prepopulated.

{:id="Texting.SendMessageDirect" class="method"} <i/> SendMessageDirect()
: Send a text message. **Using this block will add
 [dangerous permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#dangerous_permissions)
 that will require additional approval if your app is submitted to the Google Play Store.**
