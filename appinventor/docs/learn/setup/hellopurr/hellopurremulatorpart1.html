       <p>
        This page will get you started building your first app: A picture of a kitty that
                meows when you pet it. You can also
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_x9iOby0g">
         watch a video
        </a>
        (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_x9iOby0g) of this app being built. When you're
                done building Hello Purr, you'll be ready to design and build apps on your own.
                Before starting, make sure that you've
        <a href="/learn/setup/index.html">
         set up
                your computer
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       As you build Hello Purr you'll learn how the three key tools of App Inventor
              work:
       <ul>
        <li>
         The
         <b>
          Designer
         </b>
         , the place were you design your app. It runs in your web
                browser.
        </li>
        <li>
         The
         <b>
          Blocks Editor
         </b>
         , the place were you set the behavior of the app. It is
                a separate application with its own window.
        </li>
        <li>
         The
         <b>
          emulator
         </b>
         , a virtual mobile device that runs on your computer along
                side App Inventor.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        To build
        <em>
         Hello Purr
        </em>
        you'll need a picture of the kitty and also a meow
                sound. Download these files to your computer:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <a href="../../tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/kitty.png">
          kitty picture
         </a>
        </li>
        <li>
         <a href="../../tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/meow.mp3">
          meow sound
         </a>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h2>
        Start the Designer and create a new project
       </h2>
       <p>
        In your web browser, go to the App Inventor Web site at
        <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu">
         http://appinventor.mit.edu
        </a>
        . If this
                is the first time you've used App Inventor, you'll see the
        <em>
         Projects
        </em>
        page,
                with no projects in it yet. It should look like this:
       </p>
       <div class="c3">
        <img alt="" height="408" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/projects.png" width="620" />
       </div>
       <h4>
        Create a new project
       </h4>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Click
         <span class="ButtonText">
          New
         </span>
         on the left side, near the top of the
                page.
        </li>
        <li>
         Enter the project name HelloPurr (one word, with no spaces) in the dialog box
                that appears, click OK.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        The browser will open the
        <em>
         Designer
        </em>
        , the place where you select
        <em>
         components
        </em>
        for your app, and should look like this:
       </p>
       <div class="c3">
        <img alt="" height="408" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/designer.png" width="620" />
       </div>
       <h2>
        Selecting components to design your app
       </h2>
       <p>
        App Inventor components are located on the left hand side of the Designer screen
                under the title
        <b>
         Palette
        </b>
        . Components are the basic elements you use to make
                apps on the Android phone. They're like the ingredients in a recipe. Some
                components are very simple, like a
        <em>
         Label
        </em>
        component, which just shows text
                on the screen, or a
        <em>
         Button
        </em>
        component that you tap to initiate an action.
                Other components are more elaborate: a drawing
        <em>
         Canvas
        </em>
        that can hold still
                images or animations, an
        <em>
         accelerometer (motion) sensor
        </em>
        that works like a
                Wii controller and detects when you move or shake the phone, components that make
                or send text messages, components that play music and video, components that get
                information from Web sites, and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        App Inventor components are located on the left hand side of the Designer screen
                under the title
        <b>
         Palette
        </b>
        . To use a component in your app you need to click
                and drag it onto the viewer in the middle of the Designer. When you add a component
                to the viewer it will also appear in the components list on the right hand side of
                the viewer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Components have properties that can be adjusted to change the way the component
                appears within the app. To view and change the properties of a component you must
                first select the desired component in your list of components.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Steps for selecting components and setting properties
       </h4>
       <p>
        HelloPurr will use a
        <b>
         Button
        </b>
        component that has the image property set to the
                kitty.png file you downloaded earlier. To do this:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Drag and drop the
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Button
         </span>
         component to
         <b>
          Screen1
         </b>
         . The
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Button
         </span>
         component is located
                under
         <b>
          Palette
         </b>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         Click on
         <b>
          Button1
         </b>
         listed under
         <b>
          Components
         </b>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         In the list of properties, under image, click on
         <b>
          none...
         </b>
        </li>
        <li>
         Click
         <span class="ButtonText">
          add
         </span>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         Upload the the kitty.png file.
        </li>
        <li>
         Delete
         <i>
          Text for Button1
         </i>
         listed under the
         <b>
          Text
         </b>
         property.
        </li>
       </ol>
       Your Designer should look like this:
       <div class="c3">
        <img alt="" height="408" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/designerwithkittybutton.png" width="620" />
       </div>
       <h2>
        Open the Blocks Editor and connect to the emulator
       </h2>
       <p>
        The Designer is one of three key tools you'll use in creating your apps. The second
                is the
        <em>
         Blocks Editor
        </em>
        . You'll use the Blocks Editor to assign behaviors to
                your components, such as what should happen when the user of your app taps a
                button.
       </p>
       The Blocks Editor runs in a separate window. When you click
       <span class="ButtonText">
        Open the blocks editor
       </span>
       from the Designer window, the Blocks
              Editor program file should download and run. This process may take 30 seconds or
              longer. If the Blocks Editor never opens, it might be because your browser is not set
              up to run downloaded Java applications automatically. In this case, find the
              downloaded file named AppInventorForAndroidCodeblocks.jnlp and open it. The Blocks
              Editor window should look as shown below, with "drawers" for the program blocks to
              the left, and a large empty "canvas" space for placing blocks to assemble the
              program, which you'll do below.
       <div class="c3">
        <img alt="" height="360" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/blockseditorhellopurr.png" width="600" />
       </div>
       <p>
        Before continuing to build the app, you'll need to start the emulator. Click the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         New emulator
        </span>
        button at top of the window. You'll
                get a notice saying that the emulator is starting, and asking you to be patient:
                starting the emulator can take a couple of minutes. The emulator will initially
                appear with an empty black screen. Wait until the emulator is ready, with a colored
                screen background as shown below. Even after the background appears, you should
                wait until the emulated phone has finished preparing its SD card: there will be a
                notice at the top of the phone screen while the card is being prepared. You might
                also need to use your mouse on the emulated phone screen to unlock the device by
                dragging the green lock button to the right.
       </p>
       <div class="c3">
        <img alt="" height="360" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/readyemulator.png" width="200" />
       </div>
       <p>
        When the emulator is finally ready, click the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Connect to
                device...
        </span>
        button, select the emulator from the dropdown list and click it.
                You'll see a yellow animated arrow move back and forth, showing that App Inventor
                is connecting to the emulated phone. Creating this connection can take another
                minute or two. When it's all done, the arrow will stop moving and turn green, and
                if you look at the emulated phone screen, you'll see the kitty there â&euro;&rdquo; this is the
                beginning of your app!
