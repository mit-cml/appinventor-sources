  /**
   * An instruction on how the activity should be launched. There are four modes
   * that work in conjunction with activity flags (FLAG_ACTIVITY_* constants) in

   * the activity is called upon to handle an intent. They are:
   *
   * -> "standard"
   * -> "singleTop"
   * -> "singleTask"
   * -> "singleInstance"
   *
   * "standard" is the default mode and is appropriate for most types of activities.
   * "singleTop" is also a common and useful launch mode for many types of activities.
   * The other modes — "singleTask" and "singleInstance" — are not appropriate for
   * most applications, since they result in an interaction model that is likely
   * to be unfamiliar to users and is very different from most other applications.
   *
   * An activity with the "standard" or "singleTop" launch mode can be instantiated
   * multiple times. The instances can belong to any task and can be located
   * anywhere in the activity stack. Typically, they're launched into the task
   * that called {@link android.content.Context#startActivity(android.content.Intent)}
   * (unless the Intent object contains a {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK}
   * instruction, in which case a different task is chosen — see the
   * {@link #taskAffinity()} attribute).
   *
   * In contrast, "singleTask" and "singleInstance" activities can only begin a
   * task. They are always at the root of the activity stack. Moreover, the device
   * can hold only one instance of the activity at a time — only one such task.
   *
   * The "standard" and "singleTop" modes differ from each other in just one
   * respect: Every time there's a new intent for a "standard" activity, a new
   * instance of the class is created to respond to that intent. Each instance
   * handles a single intent. Similarly, a new instance of a "singleTop" activity
   * may also be created to handle a new intent. However, if the target task
   * already has an existing instance of the activity at the top of its stack,
   * that instance will receive the new intent (in an
   * {@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)} call); a new
   * instance is not created. In other circumstances — for example, if an existing
   * instance of the "singleTop" activity is in the target task, but not at the
   * top of the stack, or if it's at the top of a stack, but not in the target
   * task — a new instance would be created and pushed on the stack.
   *
   * Similarly, if you navigate up to an activity on the current stack, the
   * behavior is determined by the parent activity's launch mode. If the parent
   * activity has launch mode singleTop (or the up intent contains
   * {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP}), the parent is
   * brought to the top of the stack, and its state is preserved. The navigation
   * intent is received by the parent activity's
   * {@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)} method. If
   * the parent activity has launch mode standard (and the up intent does not
   * contain {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP}), the current
   * activity and its parent are both popped off the stack, and a new instance of
   * the parent activity is created to receive the navigation intent.
   *
   * The "singleTask" and "singleInstance" modes also differ from each other in
   * only one respect: A "singleTask" activity allows other activities to be
   * part of its task. It's always at the root of its task, but other activities
   * (necessarily "standard" and "singleTop" activities) can be launched into
   * that task. A "singleInstance" activity, on the other hand, permits no other
   * activities to be part of its task. It's the only activity in the task. If it
   * starts another activity, that activity is assigned to a different task — as
   * if {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} was in the intent.
