/**
 * ![VerticalArrangement icon](images/verticalarrangement.png)
 *
 * Use a `VerticalArrangement` component to display a group of components laid out from top to
 * bottom, left-aligned.
 *
 * This component is a formatting element in which you place components that should be displayed
 * one below another. The first child component is stored on top, the second beneath it, and so on.
 * If you want to have components displayed next to one another, use {@link HorizontalArrangement}
 * instead.
 *
 * In a `VerticalArrangement`, components are arranged along the vertical axis, left-aligned.
 *
 * If a `VerticalArrangement`'s {@link #Width()} property is set to `Automatic`, the actual width
 * of the arrangement is determined by the widest component in the arrangement whose
 * {@link #Width()} property is not set to `Fill Parent`. If a `VerticalArrangement`'s
 * {@link #Width()} property is set to `Automatic` and it contains only components whose
 * {@link #Width()} properties are set to `Fill Parent`, the actual width of the arrangement is
 * calculated using the automatic widths of the components. If a `VerticalArrangement`'s
 * {@link #Width()} property is set to `Automatic` and it is empty, the width will be 100.
 *
 * If a `VerticalArrangement`'s {@link #Height()} property is set to `Automatic`, the actual height
 * of the arrangement is determined by the sum of the heights of the components. **If a
 * `VerticalArrangement`'s {@link #Height()} property is set to `Automatic`, any components whose
 * `Height` properties are set to `Fill Parent` will behave as if they were set to `Automatic`.**
 *
 * If a `VerticalArrangement`'s {@link #Height()} property is set to `Fill Parent` or specified in
 * pixels, any components whose Height properties are set to `Fill Parent` will equally take up the
 * height not occupied by other components.
