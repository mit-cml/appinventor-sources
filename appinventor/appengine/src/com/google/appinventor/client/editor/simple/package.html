Classes for maintaining (but not creating) the component palette and the
graphical respresentation of components in the current project.  The name
of the package stems from its origin in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/simple/">Simple programming language
implementation</href>, although not all of the code in this
package or its subpackages is part of Simple.
