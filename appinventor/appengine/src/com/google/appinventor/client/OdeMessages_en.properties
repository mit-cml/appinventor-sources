AccelerometerSensorHelpStringComponentPallette=Non-visible component that can detect shaking and measure acceleration approximately in three dimensions using SI units (m/s<sup>2</sup>). The components are\: <ul><li> <strong>xAccel</strong>\: 0 when the phone is at rest on a flat surface, positive when the phone is tilted to the right (i.e., its left side is raised), and negative when the phone is tilted to the left (i.e., its right size is raised).</li> <li> <strong>yAccel</strong>\: 0 when the phone is at rest on a flat surface, positive when its bottom is raised, and negative when its top is raised. </li> <li> <strong>zAccel</strong>\: Equal to -9.8 (earth''s gravity in meters per second per second when the device is at rest parallel to the ground with the display facing up, 0 when perpendicular to the ground, and +9.8 when facing down. The value can also be affected by accelerating it with or against gravity. </li></ul>

# Description:

# Description: 
AccelerometerSensor__LegacyModePropertyDescriptions=Prior to the release that added this property the AccelerometerSensor component passed through sensor values directly as received from the Android system. However these values do not compensate for tablets that default to Landscape mode, requiring the MIT App Inventor programmer to compensate. However compensating would result in incorrect results in Portrait mode devices such as phones. We now detect Landscape mode tablets and perform the compensation. However if your project is already compensating for the change, you will now get incorrect results. Although our preferred solution is for you to update your project, you can also just set this property to “true” and our compensation code will be deactivated. Note\: We recommend that you update your project as we may remove this property in a future release.

# Description: 
FusiontablesControlHelpStringComponentPallette=<p>A non-visible component that communicates with Google Fusion Tables. Fusion Tables let you store, share, query and visualize data tables; this component lets you query, create, and modify these tables.</p> <p><font color\=red><b>NOTE\:</b>&nbsp;Google shutdown the Fusion Tables service on December 3, 2019. This component no longer functions.</font></p> <p>This component uses the <a href\="https\://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/getting_started" target\="_blank">Fusion Tables API V2.0</a>. <p>Applications using Fusion Tables must authentication to Google''s servers. There are two ways this can be done. The first way uses an API Key which you the developer obtain (see below). With this approach end-users must also login to access a Fusion Table. The second approach is to use a Service Account. With this approach you create credentials and a special "Service Account Email Address" which you obtain from the <a href\="https\://code.google.com/apis/console/" target\="_blank">Google APIs Console</a>. You then tell the Fusion Table Control the name of the Service Account Email address and upload the secret key as an asset to your application and set the KeyFile property to point at this file. Finally you check the "UseServiceAuthentication" checkbox in the designer. When using a Service Account, end-users do not need to login to use Fusion Tables, your service account authenticates all access.</p> <p>To get an API key, follow these instructions.</p> <ol><li>Go to your <a href\="https\://code.google.com/apis/console/" target\="_blank">Google APIs Console</a> and login if necessary.</li><li>Select the <i>Services</i> item from the menu on the left.</li><li>Choose the <i>Fusiontables</i> service from the list provided and turn it on.</li><li>Go back to the main menu and select the <i>API Access</i> item. </li></ol><p>Your API Key will be near the bottom of that pane in the section called "Simple API Access".You will have to provide that key as the value for the <i>ApiKey</i> property in your Fusiontables app.</p><p>Once you have an API key, set the value of the <i>Query</i> property to a valid Fusiontables SQL query and call <i>SendQuery</i> to execute the query. App Inventor will send the query to the Fusion Tables server and the <i>GotResult</i> block will fire when a result is returned from the server.Query results will be returned in CSV format, and can be converted to list format using the "list from csv table" or "list from csv row" blocks.</p><p>Note that you do not need to worry about UTF-encoding the query. But you do need to make sure the query follows the syntax described in <a href\="https\://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/getting_started" target\="_blank">the reference manual</a>, which means that things like capitalization for names of columns matters, and that single quotes must be used around column names if there are spaces in them.</p>

TinyDBHelpStringComponentPallette=TinyDB is a non-visible component that stores data for an app. <p> Apps created with App Inventor are initialized each time they run\: If an app sets the value of a variable and the user then quits the app, the value of that variable will not be remembered the next time the app is run. In contrast, TinyDB is a <em> persistent </em> data store for the app, that is, the data stored there will be available each time the app is run. An example might be a game that saves the high score and retrieves it each time the game is played. </<p> <p> Data items are strings stored under <em>tags</em> . To store a data item, you specify the tag it should be stored under. Subsequently, you can retrieve the data that was stored under a given tag. </p><p> There is only one data store per app. Even if you have multiple TinyDB components, they will use the same data store. To get the effect of separate stores, use different keys. Also each app has its own data store. You cannot use TinyDB to pass data between two different apps on the phone, although you <em>can</em> use TinyDb to shares data between the different screens of a multi-screen app. </p> <p>When you are developing apps using the AI Companion, all the apps using that companion will share the same TinyDb. That sharing will disappear once the apps are packaged. But, during development, you should be careful to clear the TinyDb each time you start working on a new app.</p>
