      http://redis.io/topics/config. Currently, the only supported parameters
      are:   *   maxmemory-policy  *   notify-keyspace-events

  Fields:
    alternativeLocationId: Optional. Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which
      protects the instance against zonal failures by provisioning it across
      two zones. If provided, it must be a different zone from the one
      provided in [location_id].
    authorizedNetwork: Optional. The full name of the Google Compute Engine
      [network](/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks) to which the
      instance is connected. If left unspecified, the `default` network will
      be used.
    createTime: Output only. The time the instance was created.
    currentLocationId: Output only. The current zone where the Redis endpoint
      is placed. For Basic Tier instances, this will always be the same as the
      [location_id] provided by the user at creation time. For Standard Tier
      instances, this can be either [location_id] or [alternative_location_id]
      and can change after a failover event.

      reserved for this instance. If not provided, the service will choose an
      unused /29 block, for example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/29. Ranges
      must be unique and non-overlapping with existing subnets in an
      authorized network.

class Status(_messages.Message):
  r"""The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting.  - Batch operations. If a
  client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

      google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
