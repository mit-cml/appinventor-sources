     *   `presentation` to avoid interfering with flyout list navigation.
     * - If the element is not focusable, it must be hidden from the ARIA tree.
     *   Only do this if the content should be inaccessible to screenreaders.
     *
     * @param state A JSON representation of an element to inflate on the flyout.
     * @param flyout The flyout on whose workspace the inflated element
     *    should be created. If the inflated element is an `IRenderedElement` it
     *    itself or the inflater should append it to the workspace; the flyout
     *    will not do so itself. The flyout is responsible for positioning the
     *    element, however.
     * @returns The newly inflated flyout element.
