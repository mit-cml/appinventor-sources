App Engine Java SDK - Release Notes

Version 1.9.17
=============
- Fixed an issue with Endpoints JSON-RPC calls failing in the Java
  development server.
    https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=11414

Version 1.9.15
=============
- Fixed an issue with Datastore stats not displaying entity counts.
    https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=9328

Version 1.9.14
=============
- The URL Fetch service will always issue a GET request when it receives
  and responds to a 302 response; previously it would preserve the original
  HTTP method. This new behavior is in line with modern conventions (see
  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4).  You can
  use the final_url field of the Response object (or a similar object in other
  APIs, see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/urlfetch/) to
  determine if your fetches are being redirected. If this change affects your
  application, please contact our support team - even if you do not have a
  support contract at
  https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/3420056?hl=en&ref_topic=3473162.

=============
- The Performance Settings section of the Application settings page in the
  Admin Console, Backends API and all backends related management tools are now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Users of Backends are
  recommended to migrate to the App Engine Modules API, which provides a more
  flexible implementation of the same functionality. These settings are now all

  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/modules/#Java_Configuration

Version 1.9.0
=============
- Java 6 applications cannot be deployed to Google App Engine from any version
  of the SDK. Existing Java 6 applications will continue to run. If you are
  still relying on a Java 6 application in Google App Engine, we strongly
  encourage you to start testing and deploying your app using Java 7. Java 7
  has been certified by Oracle to be fully backwards compatible with Java 6,
  as well as providing a number of benefits to developers. Java 7 applications
  will be fully supported in future releases of the App Engine SDK.
  If you absolutely need to continue to deploy Java 6 applications for
  compatibility reasons, you can request that your application be whitelisted
  for Java 6 deployment from http://goo.gl/ycffXq. As we review each whitelist
  application by hand, please allow 10 working days for review, and note that
  only billed applications that show a proven incompatibility will be
  considered for exemption.
- Newly created App Engine applications now have a Google Cloud Storage bucket
  created automatically as part of the same Google Cloud Project. For more
  information please see:
  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/googlecloudstorageclient/
  activate#Using_the_default_Gcs_bucket

  the SDK will only be compiled with the Java 7 compiler and the only target
  runtime will be Java 7.
- The Task Queue async API is now a GA feature. The asynchronous methods
  improve utilization by allowing your app to add, lease and delete multiple
  tasks in parallel.
- Cloud Console projects are now created by default whenever a new App Engine
  app is created.  This is a Preview feature.
- In an upcoming release the Experimental Google Cloud Storage API Functions
  will be decommissioned. This API and its Experimental status is documented at
  the following link:
  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/googlestorage/overview

- Bandwidth between App Engine and Google Cloud Storage is currently free of
  charge (this may change in the future for certain levels of service).
- The Search API has graduated from Experimental to Preview. Apps that have
  billing enabled can exceed the free quota levels and will be charged for
  usage above these levels.
- Estimated number of search results will only be accurate if it is less than
  or equal to the number of results requested. By default this can be
  overridden by setting number_found_accuracy QueryOption in the Search API.
- Dates, atoms, and number fields can now be found by searching without a field
  restriction in the Search API.
- A quoted empty string now returns atom fields with empty values for the
  Search API.
- Snippet and count functions are no longer allowed in sort expressions for the
  Search API.

  sockets. Previously, calls raised "Not Implemented" exceptions. When
  java.net.Socket.get<option>() is called, a mock value is returned, calls to
  set<option>() will be silently ignored.
- Fixed an issue with the namespace not being displayed when a user attempts
  to select a namespace in the Admin Console.
    https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=8164

  per day. Instead, apps will need to file a request through the admin console
  to get email quotas increased.
- Admin console dashboard charts and reports for all users have been fully
  migrated to the new, more reliable backend announced in 1.7.6.
- The maximum size of POST requests made through URLfetch has been increased
  from 5MB to 10MB.
- Fixed an interaction issue between the Java MapReduce library and the Files
  API which causes loss of data. If you are using the experimental Java
  MapReduce library, we strongly encourage you to update to the latest version
  of the library in the public svn:
  https://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/source/checkout

=============
- The Sockets API, which allows applications to make outgoing TCP connections
  and send/receive UDP packets to the Internet using both IPv4 and IPv6, is now
  available as an experimental feature.
- The Java runtime now defaults to Java7. If you still need to use the Java6
  runtime, please use the --use_java6 flag when deploying your app. We encourage
  you to move to Java7 as soon as possible.
- Billing enabled apps will no longer be subject to a $2.10 minimum weekly
  spend.  Instead, apps will only be charged for their actual usage.
- Fixed an issue where Datastore auto ids assigned by the scattered id
  policy were too large to be represented as floating point numbers in the SDK.
- Fixed an issue with sort by doc_id not translating correctly causing
  InvalidRequest errors in the Search API
    https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=8958

Version 1.7.6
=============
- Improvements to the App Engine billing system will be rolled out gradually to
  all apps.
- The application summary no longer displays the default version of a running
  application, instead it lists the application as 'RUNNING'. In an upcoming
  release applications will have multiple logical sub components, each of which
  will have a default version.  This UI update is meant to align with this
  functionality.
- Projection queries are now a fully supported GA feature.
- The XMPP API now has multi-JID getPresence(). This provides the ability to get
  the availability of multiple users.
- The Java dev_appserver now allocates automatic ids using the 'scattered' id
  allocation policy by default. For more information, please see "Specifying the
  Automatic ID Allocation Policy":
  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/devserver#Using_the_
  Datastore
- Admin console dashboard charts and current load/errors reports will be moving
  to a new, more reliable backend. The change will be gradually rolling to users
  of admin console over the next few weeks.
- New Search API quotas are now displayed in the Admin Console. These quotas are
  not currently enforced, but will be part of the pricing model for the Search
  API in a future release.
- The experimental Search API's ability to explicitly sort search results by
  SortExpression.RANK_FIELD_NAME (i.e. _order_id) field in ascending order has
  been removed.
- Globally consistent indexes in the experimental Search API are now deprecated
  and will be removed in the next release.
- Task Queue tasks may now be added and deleted asynchronously. This allows
  applications to perform common task queue operations without blocking. This is
  an experimental feature.
- Fixed an issue which caused an incorrect server error message when setting the
  default version on the admin console, though the version was set correctly.
- Fixed an issue that caused java.security.AccessControlException when creating
  a SOAP connection.
- Fixed an issue that caused NullPointerException in ListIndexesResponse
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=8359

Version 1.7.5
=============
- New instance classes F4_1G and B4_1G are now available.  These instances have
  compute capacity equal to F4/B4 but with a maximum of 1G RAM instead
  of 512MB.
- The DataNucleus plugin has been upgraded to 2.1.2.
- The deprecated classes AddException, AddResponse, ListException,
  ListIndexesException, ListIndexesRequest, ListIndexesResponse, ListRequest,
  ListResponse, and RemoveException were removed from the Search API in the
  SDK.  If your app references any of these classes, you must deploy a new
  version without these references before the next release of App Engine.
  If you do not do this, your app may stop working in production.
- The Conversion API, which was decommissioned last release, has been removed
  from the SDK. In a future release, the API will be removed from the
  runtime and applications that attempt to use it may stop working.
  Applications in production that import the library should be fixed as soon as
  possible.
- We are making Java 7 available as an experimental feature. We strongly
  encourage local and production testing for all existing applications. For
  more information, please visit:
  http://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/java7

  certain percentage of traffic to a non-default application version. The
  traffic is split by either cookie or IP address.
- Emails that are sent from Google Apps domains email addresses where the domain
  has been set up to use DKIM will be signed: when an email was from a request
  that originated on that app's domain or any time the email was sent from
  an app adminstrator, including when that email is sent from a cron job or task
  queue request.
- In the Admin Console, you can now choose how much and how long you'd like to

  functionality. The job occurs within your application and counts against your
  application quota, including Instance Hours, Datastore Ops and Datastore
  Storage.
- Developers can now specify how long a channel token will last until it
  expires, with the default remaining two hours. Channel API quota is now
  measured both in calls to create a channel and the number of hours of channel
  time requested. The maximum hours of quota is the maximum number of channel
  creation calls * 2, so free apps get 200 hours of requested channel token
  time.
- Task Queue API requests now include a X-Appengine-TaskETA header, that can be
  used to measure task delivery latency.
- We have removed the deprecated labs version of the TaskQueue API.

  application settings page. Three classes are available, with increasing
  memory, CPU limits, and associated cost. By default, all applications use the
  basic frontend instance setting of 128MB memory and 600MHz CPU.
- We've added new functionality to the Log API that will allow you to read your
  application's logs programmatically.
- We are releasing an experimental Conversion API that will allow you to convert
  between document types including .doc, .html, .pdf, images using OCR, and
  more.
- The High Replication Datastore migration utility is now available as a GA
  feature, and is no longer experimental.

Version 1.6.0
=============
- On November 7th, App Engine will be out of Preview. The new Terms of Service
  and previously announced pricing changes will be in effect. Additionally, all
  paid apps are now covered by our SLA.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html
- Paid apps can now specify the maximum pending latency for instances and the
  minimum number of idle instances for your application in the Admin Console.
- Task Queue storage has been separated in to its own line item. Previously,
  this was included in Datastore storage.
- We have released an experimental utility, available in the Admin Console, to
  assist in migrating your application to the High Replication datastore. This
  utility allows you to copy the bulk of your data in the background, while the
  source application is still serving. You then need a brief read-only period to
  migrate your application data while you copy the data that has changed from
  the time the original copy started.
- Blobstore, which was previously limited to apps with billing enabled, is now
  available for all apps.
- We have published a new article on Datastore Index Selection and Advanced
  Search which explains our recent improvements to the query planner that make
  exploding indexes unnecessary.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/indexselection.html
- Applications can now receive xmpp error stanzas at /_ah/xmpp/error.
- In the Admin Console data viewer, you can now filter by namespace from a drop
  down menu, if applicable.

  for filtering stats.
- Added API functionality for making calls to the Memcache API asynchronously.
- In the Memcache API, getIdentifiable() and putIfUntouched() now support
  batch operations.
- We've added a page, /_ah/admin/capabilitiesstatus, to the dev console that
  allows you to configure the capability state of the local API implementations
  when running locally.
- We've added LocalCapabilitiesServiceTestConfig to the testing API, which
  allows you to configure the capability state of the local API implementations
  in your tests.
- The Datastore API now supports callbacks that can execute before or after
  put() and delete() calls.
- The queue-name argument is now optional for async-session-persistence in
  appengine-web.xml.
- Fixed a ClassNotFound error when using async-session-persistence.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5774
- Fixed an issue with memcache serialization when using a entity key with a name
  that points to the same reference as the key's parent.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2088
- Fixed an issue where DoS stats in the Admin Console didn't work for High
  Replication apps.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5237
- WARNING: Starting with 1.6.1 (our next release, NOT this release), URLFetch
  requests will honor the Accept-Encoding header. If your code sets this header
  then it must be prepared to receive content of the specified type. For more
  information please see
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4978

Version 1.5.5

  seconds. The default deadline remains at 10 seconds. The offline maximum deadline
  for URLFetch remains at 10 minutes.
- We have increased the URLFetch Post payload from 1MB to 5MB.
- App Engine now supports Cross Group (XG) transactions with the High
  Replication Datastore, which allow you to perform transactions across multiple
  entity groups.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/transactions.html
- We have added a graph to the admin console that displays the number of
  instances for which you will be billed.
- In the XMPP API, getPresence() is deprecated in favor of using the inbound
  presence handlers documented in
  http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/xmpp/overview.html#Handling_User_Presence.
- Fixed an issue in the Admin Console where the "Run Now" button did not work
  for tasks with a '-' in the name.

Version 1.5.4
=============
- You can now specify the maximum size for a blob in
  BlobstoreService.createUploadUrl().
- Zigzag merge join queries will now continue scanning up to the 30 second
  Datastore query deadline. For zigzag queries that used to generate
  DatastoreNeedIndexException, many will now succeed. A small percentage will
  now instead timeout.
- The SDK datastore viewer in the dev console now displays the number of "Write
  Ops" for each entity. "Write Ops" are the total number of entity and index
  writes that were required to create the entity.
- The Prospective Search API is available in Java for all applications. This API
  is still experimental, so applications will be limited to a maximum of 1000
  subscriptions.
- We made a classloading improvement that we expect to help loading request
  latencies for projects with large numbers of jars.
- Added support for the set_default_version flag to Appcfg.
- The Java Remote API now recognizes the HTTP_X_APPENGINE_INBOUND_APPID. This
  means that the Datastore Admin copy functionality will work when using
  Java's Remote API with the destination app.
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly allowed creation of tasks with whitespace in
  the url.
- Fixed the error message for "transaction not found" to be more descriptive.
- Fixed an issue with the dev appserver's local Blobstore implementation trying
  to modify an immutable collection.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3081
- Fixed an SDK issue where CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST logging messages were not
  displayed.

  uploaded from your war directory.
- AppCfg now supports the -V (version) and -A (application) flags.
- Added app_identity api with methods to work with service accounts for
  asserting identity on outbound HTTP calls.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/appidentity/overview.html
- Added an improved HRD migration tool that requires a read-only period relative
  to your datastore write rate (as opposed to your datastore size, which is how
  the current version behaves). The tool is not yet generally available.  If you
  are interested in being an early adopter please fill out this form:
  http://goo.gl/3jrXu
- Fixed an issue in the Channel API where jsapi was not served with the correct
  mime type.
- Fixed an issue where blobs could not be uploaded using HTTPS.

Version 1.5.2
=============
- You can now specify the minimum pending latency for instances and the maximum
  number of idle instances for your application in the Admin Console.
- The datastore now never requires an exploding index.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queries.html#Big_Entities_and_Exploding_Indexes
- The SDK will now never suggest indexes with the same property repeated, as
  such indexes are likely to be exploding indexes.
- Datastore stats are now available on a per-namespace basis.

Version 1.5.0.1
===============
- Fixed a bug that caused appengine-jsr107cache-1.5.0.jar to be empty.

Version 1.5.0
=============
- Support for Backends which allow developers to create infrastructure
  components that complement the existing dynamic apps that App Engine already
  provides. Instances of a backend can maintain state, be addressed
  individually, and are not subject to per-request time limits. They can also be
  configured to consume more memory and CPU than ordinary dynamic instances.
- Task Queues support pull mode, allowing for more control over task queue work
  rates. To use pull queues, include the 'mode' element in your queue.xml.
- Pull queues are supported by a REST API, allowing access from outside App
  Engine. To use the REST API, you must also include a valid ACL section
  specifying which users can lease tasks from the pull queue.
- Task Queue payload limits have been increased. Queues support 100KB per task.
  Within App Engine, the new limit is 32 MB per batch of tasks. With the REST
  API the limit is 1 MB per batch.
- HTTP request and response sizes have been increased to 32 MB.
- We have removed the rate quotas for requests, datastore operations,
  memcache operations, and image API operations. Resource quotas still apply.

  Datastore as the default configuration option.  Developers that still wish to
  use the Master/Slave configuration must explicitly choose this option at
  application creation time.
- The Task Queue maximum configurable processing rate has been increased to
  500/s.
- Modified Dashboard latency graphs to indicate they only include dynamic
  requests.
- We have added two restrictions to the Mail API to improve the reliability
  of the service for all applications.
  - Emails must be sent from email accounts managed by Google (either Gmail or
    a domain signed up for Google Apps).

- The Admin Console Task Queues page now displays a more accurate estimate of
  queue size for queues containing more than 2000 tasks.
- Java applications can enable concurrent request support by setting
  <threadsafe> to True in their appengine-web.xml. This flag indicates that
  request handlers for your app are thread safe and multiple request handlers
  may safely run at the same time in the same memory space for your application.
- Deferred library support now available in Java.

Version 1.4.1
=============
There were no updates to the Java SDK for the 1.4.1 App Engine release.

Version 1.4.0
=============
- The Always On feature allows applications to pay and keep 3 instances of their
  application always running, which can significantly reduce application
  latency.
- Developers can now enable Warmup Requests. By specifying  a handler in an
  app's appengine-web.xml, App Engine will attempt to send a Warmup Request to
  initialize new instances before a user interacts with it. This can reduce the
  latency an end-user sees for initializing your application.
- The Channel API is now available for all users.
- Task Queue has been officially released, and is no longer an experimental
  feature. The API import paths that use 'labs' have been deprecated. Task queue
  storage will count towards an application's overall storage quota, and will
  thus be charged for.
- The deadline for Task Queue and Cron requests has been raised to 10 minutes.
  Datastore and API deadlines within those requests remain unchanged.
- For the Task Queue, developers can specify task retry-parameters in their
  queue.xml.
- Apps that have enabled billing are allowed up to 100 queues with the Task
  Queue API.
- Metadata Queries on the datastore for datastore kinds, namespaces, and entity
  properties are available.
- URL Fetch allowed response size has been increased, up to 32 MB. Request size
  is still limited to 1 MB.
- The request and response sizes for the Images API have been increased to
  32 MB.
- The total size of Memcache batch operations is increased to 32 MB. The 1 MB
  limit on individual Memcache objects still applies.
- The attachment size for outgoing emails has been increased from 1 MB to 10 MB.
  The size limit for incoming emails is still 10 MB.
- Size and quantity limits on datastore batch get/put/delete operations have
  been removed. Individual entities are still limited to 1 MB, but your app may
  batch as many entities together for get/put/delete calls as the overall
  datastore deadline will allow for.
- When iterating over query results, the datastore will now asynchronously
  prefetch results, reducing latency in many cases by 10-15%.
- The Admin Console Blacklist page lists the top blacklist rejected visitors.
- The automatic image thumbnailing service supports arbitrary crop sizes up to
  1600px.
- Overall average instance latency in the Admin Console is now a weighted
  average over QPS per instance.
- Added a low-level AysncDatastoreService for making calls to the datastore
  asynchronously.
- Added a getBodyAsBytes() method to QueueStateInfo.TaskStateInfo, this returns
  the body of the task state as a pure byte-string.
- The whitelist has been updated to include all classes from javax.xml.soap.
- Fixed an issue sending email to multiple recipients.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1623

  sessions. For more information see:
    http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=181599
- In queue.xml, the maximum allowed bucket size is now 100.
- Removed limits on zigzag merge-join queries. Therefore the error "The built-in
  indices are not efficient enough for this query and your data. Please add a
  composite index for this query." will no longer be thrown in most cases,
  enabling more types of queries without indexes.
- The whitelist has been updated to include java.net.InetAddress and some
  interfaces and abstract classes in javax.xml.soap, including
  javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage.
- Fixed an issue reserving App Ids by owners of emails containing periods,
  multiple cases, and googlemail.com address.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1196
- Fixed an issue where TaskOptions had no public getters, making testing
  impossible.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3243
- Fixed an issue on the development server where PNGs were being returned as
  JPEGs.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3661

- Increased several rate limited quotas for free applications.
- Fixed an issue that did not allow forms of over 200,000 bytes to be submitted.
   http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1608

Version 1.3.5
=============
- Ability to configure the Task Queue storage limit with the
  total-storage-limit field in the queue.xml file.
- Task Queues now support up to 50 qps per queue, up from 50 qps per app.
