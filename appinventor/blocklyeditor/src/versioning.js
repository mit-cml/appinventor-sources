 *
 * This is a dictionary of upgrade maps, one map per component type plus
 * one map for the special string "Language" (for upgrading blocks language version)
 * The component type "Form" is handled as "Screen".
 *
 * This dictionary expresses in a more declarative form the updating conditionals
 * in Liz Looney's BlockSave.java file from App Inventor Classic.
 *
 * In the upgrade map for a particular component type, an entry labeled with version number n
 * specifies what needs to be done to upgrade components at version n-1 to version n.
 * Each entry maps to either:
 *   (1) an upgrading function,
 *   (2) an array of upgraders,
 *   (3) a special upgrading string.
 *
 * An upgrading function is a single-argument function that takes and returns a
 * blocks program representation, which is either:
 *   (1) a top-level XML DOM element ,or
 *   (2) a Blockly.Workspace object
 * Modifications (by side effect) can be made to whichever of these representations is more convenient.
 * The utility functions Blockly.Versioning.ensureDom and Blockly.Versioning.ensureWorkspace
 * can be used to ensure that the representation is of a certain type, converting it
 * if it is not of that type. The framework allows the representation to ping-pong
 * back and forth between these representation types, and guaranteees that the
 * final representation is the workspace expected by Blockly.
 *
 * A list of upgraders is treated as the sequential composition of the functions
 * for each upgrader.
 *
 * The two special strings for blocks upgraders are:
 *
 *   "noUpgrade": No upgrade needs to be performed.
 *
 *   "ai1CantDoUpgrade": There was a nontrivial upgrader for AI1 in BlockSaveFile.java,
 *      but this upgrader cannot be replicated in AI2.
 *
 * Each upgrader is preceded by a comment that describes the upgrade.
 * For historical purposes, the upgrades from App Inventor Classic (from BlockSaveFile.java)
 * are documented here, even though the nontrival upgrades can no longer be performed.
