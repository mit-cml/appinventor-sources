  Enums:
    EncodingValueValuesEnum: Encoding of audio data sent in all
      `RecognitionAudio` messages. This field is optional for `FLAC` and `WAV`
      audio files and required for all other audio formats. For details, see
      AudioEncoding.

  Fields:
    audioChannelCount: *Optional* The number of channels in the input audio
      data. ONLY set this for MULTI-CHANNEL recognition. Valid values for
      LINEAR16 and FLAC are `1`-`8`. Valid values for OGG_OPUS are '1'-'254'.
      Valid value for MULAW, AMR, AMR_WB and SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE is only
      `1`. If `0` or omitted, defaults to one channel (mono). Note: We only
      recognize the first channel by default. To perform independent
      recognition on each channel set
      `enable_separate_recognition_per_channel` to 'true'.
    enableAutomaticPunctuation: *Optional* If 'true', adds punctuation to
      recognition result hypotheses. This feature is only available in select
      languages. Setting this for requests in other languages has no effect at
      all. The default 'false' value does not add punctuation to result
      hypotheses. Note: This is currently offered as an experimental service,
      complimentary to all users. In the future this may be exclusively
      available as a premium feature.
    enableSeparateRecognitionPerChannel: This needs to be set to `true`
      explicitly and `audio_channel_count` > 1 to get each channel recognized
      separately. The recognition result will contain a `channel_tag` field to
      state which channel that result belongs to. If this is not true, we will
      only recognize the first channel. The request is billed cumulatively for
      all channels recognized: `audio_channel_count` multiplied by the length
      of the audio.
    enableWordTimeOffsets: *Optional* If `true`, the top result includes a
      list of words and the start and end time offsets (timestamps) for those
      words. If `false`, no word-level time offset information is returned.
      The default is `false`.
    encoding: Encoding of audio data sent in all `RecognitionAudio` messages.
      This field is optional for `FLAC` and `WAV` audio files and required for
      all other audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding.
    languageCode: *Required* The language of the supplied audio as a
      [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag.
      Example: "en-US". See [Language Support](/speech-to-text/docs/languages)
      for a list of the currently supported language codes.
    maxAlternatives: *Optional* Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be
      returned. Specifically, the maximum number of
      `SpeechRecognitionAlternative` messages within each
      `SpeechRecognitionResult`. The server may return fewer than
      `max_alternatives`. Valid values are `0`-`30`. A value of `0` or `1`
      will return a maximum of one. If omitted, will return a maximum of one.
    metadata: *Optional* Metadata regarding this request.
    model: *Optional* Which model to select for the given request. Select the
      model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not
      explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the
      parameters in the RecognitionConfig. <table>   <tr>
      <td><b>Model</b></td>     <td><b>Description</b></td>   </tr>   <tr>
      <td><code>command_and_search</code></td>     <td>Best for short queries
      such as voice commands or voice search.</td>   </tr>   <tr>
      <td><code>phone_call</code></td>     <td>Best for audio that originated
      from a phone call (typically     recorded at an 8khz sampling
      rate).</td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td><code>video</code></td>     <td>Best
      for audio that originated from from video or includes multiple
      speakers. Ideally the audio is recorded at a 16khz or greater
      sampling rate. This is a premium model that costs more than the
      standard rate.</td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td><code>default</code></td>
      <td>Best for audio that is not one of the specific audio models.
      For example, long-form audio. Ideally the audio is high-fidelity,
      recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate.</td>   </tr> </table>
    profanityFilter: *Optional* If set to `true`, the server will attempt to
      filter out profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each
      filtered word with asterisks, e.g. "f***". If set to `false` or omitted,
      profanities won't be filtered out.
    sampleRateHertz: Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent in all
      `RecognitionAudio` messages. Valid values are: 8000-48000. 16000 is
      optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of the audio source to
      16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample rate of the
      audio source (instead of re-sampling). This field is optional for
      `FLAC`,  `WAV`. and 'MP3' audio files, and is required for all other
      audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding.
    speechContexts: *Optional* array of SpeechContext. A means to provide
      context to assist the speech recognition. For more information, see
      [Phrase Hints](/speech-to-text/docs/basics#phrase-hints).
    useEnhanced: *Optional* Set to true to use an enhanced model for speech
      recognition. If `use_enhanced` is set to true and the `model` field is
      not set, then an appropriate enhanced model is chosen if: 1. project is
      eligible for requesting enhanced models 2. an enhanced model exists for
      the audio  If `use_enhanced` is true and an enhanced version of the
      specified model does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the
      standard version of the specified model.  Enhanced speech models require
      that you opt-in to data logging using instructions in the [documentation
      ](/speech-to-text/docs/enable-data-logging). If you set `use_enhanced`
      to true and you have not enabled audio logging, then you will receive an
      error.

    Values:
      ENCODING_UNSPECIFIED: Not specified.
      LINEAR16: Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear PCM).
      FLAC: `FLAC` (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding
        because it is lossless--therefore recognition is not compromised--and
        requires only about half the bandwidth of `LINEAR16`. `FLAC` stream
        encoding supports 16-bit and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields
        in `STREAMINFO` are supported.
      MULAW: 8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using G.711 PCMU
        /mu-law.
      AMR: Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be
        8000.
      AMR_WB: Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be
        16000.
      OGG_OPUS: Opus encoded audio frames in Ogg container
        ([OggOpus](https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus)). `sample_rate_hertz` must
        be one of 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, or 48000.
      SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE: Although the use of lossy encodings is not
        recommended, if a very low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is
        highly preferred over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/)
        encoding supported by Cloud Speech API has a header byte in each
        block, as in MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a
        variant of the RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC
        5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a sequence
        of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts with a byte
        containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed by one or more
        frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number of bytes (octets)
        as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced
        with a single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband is
        supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 16000.

class Status(_messages.Message):
  r"""The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting.  - Batch operations. If a
  client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
