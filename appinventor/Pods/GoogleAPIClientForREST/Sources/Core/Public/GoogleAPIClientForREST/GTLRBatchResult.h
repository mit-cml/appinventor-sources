/**
 *  A batch result includes a dictionary of successes, a dictionary of failures, and a dictionary of
 *  HTTP response headers.
 *
 *  Dictionary keys are request ID strings; dictionary values are @c GTLRObject for
 *  successes, @c GTLRErrorObject for failures, @c NSDictionary for responseHeaders.
 *
 *  For successes with no returned object (such as from delete operations),
 *  the object for the dictionary entry is @c NSNull.
 *
 *  The original query for each result is available from the service ticket, as shown in
 *  the code snippet here.
 *
 *  When the queries in the batch are unrelated, adding a @c completionBlock to each of
 *  the queries may be a simpler way to handle the batch results.
 *
 *  @code
 *  NSDictionary *successes = batchResults.successes;
 *  for (NSString *requestID in successes) {
 *    GTLRObject *obj = successes[requestID];
 *    GTLRQuery *query = [ticket queryForRequestID:requestID];
 *    NSLog(@"Query %@ returned object %@", query, obj);
 *  }
