/** \brief
 * Contains classes that perform a topological overlay to compute boolean
 * spatial functions.
 *
 * The Overlay Algorithm is used in spatial analysis methods for computing
 * set-theoretic operations (boolean combinations) of input {@link Geometry}s.
 * The algorithm for computing the overlay uses the intersection operations
 * supported by topology graphs.
 * To compute an overlay it is necessary to explicitly compute the resultant
 * graph formed by the computed intersections.
 *
 * The algorithm to compute a set-theoretic spatial analysis method has the
 * following steps:
 *
 *  - Build topology graphs of the two input geometries.  For each geometry all
 *    self-intersection nodes are computed and added to the graph.
 *  - Compute nodes for all intersections between edges and nodes of the graphs.
 *  - Compute the labeling for the computed nodes by merging the labels from
 *    the input graphs.
 *  - Compute new edges between the compute intersection nodes.
 *    Label the edges appropriately.
 *  - Build the resultant graph from the new nodes and edges.
 *  - Compute the labeling for isolated components of the graph.  Add the
 *    isolated components to the resultant graph.
 *  - Compute the result of the boolean combination by selecting the node
 *    and edges with the appropriate labels. Polygonize areas and sew linear
 *    geometries together.
