/**
 * A class that contains the {@link QuadEdge}s representing a planar
 * subdivision that models a triangulation.
 * The subdivision is constructed using the
 * quadedge algebra defined in the classs {@link QuadEdge}.
 * All metric calculations
 * are done in the {@link Vertex} class.
 * In addition to a triangulation, subdivisions
 * support extraction of Voronoi diagrams.
 * This is easily accomplished, since the Voronoi diagram is the dual
 * of the Delaunay triangulation.
 * <p>
 * Subdivisions can be provided with a tolerance value. Inserted vertices which
 * are closer than this value to vertices already in the subdivision will be
 * ignored. Using a suitable tolerance value can prevent robustness failures
 * from happening during Delaunay triangulation.
 * <p>
 * Subdivisions maintain a <b>frame</b> triangle around the client-created
 * edges. The frame is used to provide a bounded "container" for all edges
 * within a TIN. Normally the frame edges, frame connecting edges, and frame
 * triangles are not included in client processing.
