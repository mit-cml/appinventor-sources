/** \brief

 * This check is required for any reasonable polygonal model
 * (including the OGC-SFS model, as well as models which allow ring
 * self-intersection at single points)
 *
 * Checks include:
 *
 *  - test for rings which properly intersect
 *    (but not for ring self-intersection, or intersections at vertices)
 *  - test for consistent labelling at all node points
 *    (this detects vertex intersections with invalid topology,
 *    i.e. where the exterior side of an edge lies in the interior of the area)
 *  - test for duplicate rings
 *
 * If an inconsistency is found the location of the problem
 * is recorded and is available to the caller.
