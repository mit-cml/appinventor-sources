/** \mainpage GEOS - Geometry Engine Open Source
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Geometry Engine Open Source is a C++ port of the Java Topology Suite
 * released under the LGPL license.
 * It has interfaces for C++, C and python (though swig).
 *
 * \section getstart_sec Getting Started
 *
 * The recommended low-level interface to the GEOS library
 * is the simplified \ref c_iface. This will ensure stability of the
 * API and the ABI of the library during performance improvements
 * that will likely change classes definitions.
 *
 * If you don't care about adapting/rebuilding your client code
 * you can still use the \ref cpp_iface.
 */

/** \page c_iface C wrapper interface
 *
 * \section Overview
 *
 * This is the preferred access method for GEOS.
 *
 * It is designed to keep binary compatibility across releases.
 *
 * \section Usage
 *
 * In order to use the C-API of geos you must link your code against
 * libgeos_c.so and include the geos_c.h header file, which also contain
 * function-level documentation.
 *
 */

/** \page cpp_iface C++ interface
 *
 * \section Overview
 *
 * Main class is geos::geom::Geometry, from which all geometry types
 * derive.
 *
 * Construction and destruction of Geometries is done
 * using geos::geom::GeometryFactory.
 *
 * You'll feed it geos::geom::CoordinateSequence
 * for base geometries or vectors of geometries for collections.
 *
 * If you need to construct geometric shaped geometries, you
 * can use geos::geom::GeometricShapeFactory.
 *
 * GEOS version info (as a string) can be obtained using
 * geos::geom::geosversion(). The JTS version this release has been
 * ported from is available throu geos::geom::jtsport().
 *
 * \section io_sect Input / Output
 *
 * For WKT input/output you can use geos::io::WKTReader and geos::io::WKTWriter
 *
 * For WKB input/output you can use geos::io::WKBReader and geos::io::WKBWriter
 *
 * \section exc_sect Exceptions
 *
 * Internal exceptions are thrown as instances geos::util::GEOSException or
 * derived classes. GEOSException derives from std::exception.
 *
 * Note that prior to version 3.0.0, GEOSException were thrown by
 * pointer, and did not derive from std::exception.
