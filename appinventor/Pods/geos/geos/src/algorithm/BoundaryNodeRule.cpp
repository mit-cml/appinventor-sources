/**
 * A {@link BoundaryNodeRule} which specifies that any points
 * which are endpoints
 * of lineal components are in the boundary of the
 * parent geometry.
 * This corresponds to the "intuitive" topological definition
 * of boundary.
 * Under this rule {@link LinearRing}s have a non-empty boundary
 * (the common endpoint of the underlying LineString).
 * <p>
 * This rule is useful when dealing with linear networks.
 * For example, it can be used to check
 * whether linear networks are correctly noded.
 * The usual network topology constraint is that linear segments may
 * touch only at endpoints.
 * In the case of a segment touching a closed segment (ring) at one
 * point,
 * the Mod2 rule cannot distinguish between the permitted case of
 * touching at the
 * node point and the invalid case of touching at some other interior
 * (non-node) point.
 * The EndPoint rule does distinguish between these cases,
 * so is more appropriate for use.
